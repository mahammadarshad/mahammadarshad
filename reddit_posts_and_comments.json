            "I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way.",
            "Wow I could have posted this, my thoughts exactly. I hope your depression gets better as well soon",
            "I agree 100% \n\nI've lived with depression for 26 years, anxiety for the latter 7 of them. Anxiety has caused me to be borderline reclusive, I've been afraid to be in large crowds, panic if I'm in a place with loud music playing, and won't go outside if there are people nearby. \n\nBefore anxiety hit me, I could live with depression. I could manage for the most part. I used to enjoy the aforementioned scenarios, used to go to concerts even. Anxiety saps the fun out of life much more than depression can, in my opinion.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Same. I rather feel nothing at all than pure panic all the time.",
            "Interesting, I feel the opposite. My anxiety is much more severe and debilitating for me compared to my depression (I know all is valid but depression wise I have always been able to function relatively okay). I probably only get depressed once or twice a week for just a few hours. Sometimes I do experience longer stretches, like 4-5 days. The hopelessness is crushing to me. Feeling like nothing can get better. Then suicidal ideation creeps in. I typically have gone back and forth with which one I \u201cprefer\u201d, but this past winter was pretty rough for me. I don\u2019t really want to say I prefer anxiety over depression, but personally for me, nothing is worse than hopelessness.\n\nAlthough I find my anxiety to onset depression at times, but not really the other way around.",
            "I have to respectfully disagree.  They both suck tremendously, but when I\u2019m depressed, it\u2019s like a cascade in my brain.  It feels like I\u2019ll never think anything in the world will ever be fun again.  That feeling of wanting to want to enjoy something and not being able to is torture.\n\nAnxiety is it\u2019s own torture.  But with anxiety, I\u2019m being stimulated and, while it sometimes doesn\u2019t work, I feel like I have tools to fix it and I just have to rummage through the tool box to find the right tool.  It\u2019s an event, a challenge, I\u2019m doing something and I feel like I have a little bit of control.\n\nThat\u2019s just my way of looking at it, but I completely understand how you feel.",
            "Same. When I'm depressed I genuinely dgaf about anything anymore, that goes the same for my anxiety. When my anxiety is more powerful than me being depressed I generally feel like I can't get my mind to shut up",
            "I\u2019m the same way. I just finally went and got medication last week because I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The depression was easier because at least I wasn\u2019t afraid that I was going to drop dead at any moment. I had horrible hypochondria.",
            "Both are equally awful for me",
            "Depression is calming compared to anxiety, I\u2019ve had bad anxiety attack this week and right now I wish I could go back.",
            "I think it's normal to feel adjusted to a certain degree of depression. It's hard to imagine yourself without it, so in a weird way, we can become comfortable within that. Baseline's are called that for a reason, because it's the level we're most used to operating out of and always come back to, ya know? That's how I see it anyways. \n\nIt is important to try to work on that and not become complacent to it always having to be that way, but if you're feeling particularly stressed and burnt out at the moment, it is okay to sit back from that and find a space that feels tolerable, quite like you said.  I've been feeling really exhausted lately myself so I'm moving through similar feelings right now, and it can be tricky to navigate when you're constantly negotiating between different/opposing states of being. Remember to try and be as kind to yourself as you can!",
            "I felt extremely anxious/nervous for around an hour today and it ruined the whole day for me. After everything was over i was so tired and shaking. I spent the rest of the day in bed. I can\u2019t focus on anything either, my brain is just so tired that I can\u2019t think. Anxiety is the worst.",
            "Fuck yes! Any day! Anxiety is more physically uncomfortable. It feels exactly like terror. Nausea, sweats, waves of tingles, rapid heart rate, total bowel liquidation... I recently realized that what I used to think of as \"scared I was going to be in trouble\" for being late or skipping school was actually anxiety. I couldn't sleep to the point my mom took me to the Dr. but she was in the room, so when he asked if I was \"worried about anything\" I gave a firm no and he put me on sleeping pills for a couple weeks. I would sleep on the couch, because I was so hot I needed the ceiling fan, and I would play music to distract my brain and run back and forth to the toilet until I finally passed out. I self diagnosed my anxiety based on a friend posting about her anxiety on Facebook, TWO DECADES later.\n\nSorry, that got long hahaha",
            "thought these exact things the other night. anxiety is so overwhelming. depression is just bleh. i prefer to be \"bleh\"",
            "Deadass. Last year when I was struggling with both anxiety and depression at the same time, I would prefer the latter because sleeping and feeling nothingwas far better than throwing up and not being able to eat everyday",
            "I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019d much rather feel depression over anxiety. I\u2019d much rather feel numb than heart palpitations and sleepless nights because I can\u2019t seem to ease my anxiety. Hoping you feel better soon.",
            "feeling nothing is better than feeling like shit",
            "Ive always said, I firmly believe my depression would be so much easier to cope with if I didn't have anxiety. My anxiety is ten times worse than my depression, and most of my depressive thoughts come from my anxiety.",
            "anxiety sucks so much I can't even describe it , and it hit at random times for no apparent reasons",
            "When I get out of a depressive time, the anxiety is overwhelming if I think about how much of my life I\u2019m wasting in depressive episodes.",
            "The indecision of this post title speaks **volumes**",
            "I\u2019d rather not have either! Tbh I think I\u2019ve got used to having a low mood. In the past I\u2019ve had depression, where I\u2019ve just sat on my bed all day and cried and hardly eat. I get some weeks where, like many on this thread feel hopeless and suicidal ideation is at the forefront of my mind.  That usually lasts for about a week and I come out of it. Depends what has triggered me. The worst is my GAD. I hate it and it really has affected my whole life. I used to be able to manage, work, see friends. Now it\u2019s just got really messy and I feel stuck. Covid19 just about finished me off tbh, my major problem is intolerance of uncertainty, so you can imagine what my GAD has been like for the past few months.  \n\nI just wish I could take my brain out, reboot it and start again. Maybe one day I\u2019ll be 10% less anxious but I know that\u2019s down to me to retrain my thought patterns.",
            "I have days where I feel \u201cempty\u201d and I actually prefer those days over being anxious all day.",
            "Same. I find my depression a lot easier to manage than my anxiety. I find it a lot easier to identify a depression thought than an anxiety one too, I constantly feel like I\u2019m having to second guess myself with anxiety and it\u2019s exhausting in a way that depression exhaustion just isn\u2019t.",
            "Yes! Been feeling this lately. I am so anxious about my health. When I was depressed I didn't care if I lived or died.",
            "I had a few weeks of very high and new anxiety and now I\u2019m still having a lot of anxiety but low energy and flat affects and poor moods. Is this common? How exactly do I work on it, other than attacking the source of the anxiety?",
            "It\u2019s weird, after lots of anxiety I almost enjoy the come down of being depressed",
            "They're exhausting in different ways but I definitely agree. Anxiety is my brain going 120mph and depression is my brain going 12mph in first gear. Not being able to hear yourself think is worse than not thinking at all.",
            "I feel this. I prefer being depressed over anxious any day.",
            "I feel this. Anxiety just feels like depression on crack. Constant fear. High pulse. Nonstop worrying. Sleepless nights. Being exhausted, but unable to rest. Panic attacks. Breakdowns.\n\nDepression just feels like a break at that point.",
            "I\u2019ll take depression over anxiety any day. I feel like I can\u2019t even breathe anymore. It\u2019s fucking with my chest acting like I need that full extra breath that I can\u2019t get. I can\u2019t take it anymore. My back hurts and I keep thinking the worst is going to happen.",
            "Each to their own. \n\nMy anxiety meds make me depressed which is why I don't take them.\n\nWith anxiety I at least get to feel happiness and joy and love sometimes, next to the terror and horrible anxiety. Depression is just numb and unfeeling and sad. And that made me feel way worse. I'd rather be happy and anxious than depressed.",
            "First time I\u2019ve ever responded on Reddit and I totally agree. Experiencing both while crap, I\u2019d easily choose depression over anxiety. Stay strong. It\u2019s one of those things that until you\u2019ve been through, you can never really grasp just how weird and awful it feels. And yet we look normal and fine to the outside world!",
            "Me too. Anxiety is unbearable. ):",
            "\nYeah, depression is better. Least you can become emotionally numb and just stop caring for a while. Not caring about anything at all.",
            "Damn, I feel this way too. Sometimes the only relief I get from my anxiety, is my depression. It's no way to live, but it's what I've got. But then, after a while, my depression gets so bad it feels like I'm rotting away from the inside.",
            "For real!! And I don\u2019t mean it to be insensitive to anyone w depression but just w my own experiences with both I would literally trade anxiety for any amount of depression I can\u2019t even describe. Idk if this makes sense but like I was so much happier when I was depressed lol",
            "Mate, you don\u2019t know how right you are, anxiety for me is a good beating from Khabib Nurmagomedov, and Depression is a light tickle from Mr. T...... both are bad of course but for me I can tolerate depression better, anxiety just puts me in a choke hold position and I cannot move a muscle.",
            "I have had anxiety and depression for over fifteen years... In my experience with them,  anxiety is worse, for me. I can function with depression,  I know the depression moods,  thoughts,  and behaviors.  Anxiety,  it is always changing,  finding new ways to debilitate me,  so I can never ever learn how to beat it,  to manage it. It's all consuming.",
            "for me anxiety is feeling as if something bad is about to happen and depression is feeling as if something bad has already happened.",
            "Wow I literally said this exact thing last night. I know it\u2019s unhealthy but I find so much comfort when the emptiness and lethargy and sadness comes back, it\u2019s blissful not constantly being on edge and feeling sick to my stomach",
            "Yup, totally agree. Depression feels almost like a holiday after all the anxiety. \nEspecially when your panic mode trigger is your own body.",
            "OH GOD I TOTALLY AGREE.  As a person with GAD, it drains all the energy and leaves me in ruins. Depression followed by intense anxiety kinda calm the nerves and collects the energy to be anxious again.",
            "I never actually thought of it that way! But now I realize that I\u2019m\nThe same. I hate my anxiety it gets in the way of everything and it blocks me from actually living my life I feel like nobody understands me. But depression is fine I guess over anxiety it just depends what\u2019s causing me to be depressed.",
            "I've never thought of it.  Normally I would agree but I can definitely think of times in my life where I wouldn't.",
            "I get what u mean but with anxiety I feel like I have a reason to live while depression makes me feel like i should give up leading to irrational choices",
            "I\u2019m always tired or anxious. I often mistake being tired for being depressed..they are very similar. Good for you for allowing yourself to hold that space for yourself when you need it. Much love",
            "I have OCD and now I wish I could have just gone back to being depressed. Its odd because OCD makes your brain ask some fucked up questions and just sets you down a road where you're scared of everything.",
            "Agree with this 100%. \n\nThough my main thing is severe anxiety. Depression is second. I\u2019ve been in the dark places, but I can only imagine what it\u2019s like to be completely engulfed in that void of depression. \n\nThey\u2019re both horrible.",
            "I think they both suck!  Nothing worse than the combo.  I was told that anxiety is actually a form of depression.",
            "Same. I can't function well either way, so might as well ride it out with numb meaningless existence rather than internal screaming. But realistically, and unfortunately, we can never choose ;(",
            "I understand so much.. anxiety is just one of the worst/draining afflictions, so when it runs it course at times and I'm left just so tired but still depressed it is still a relief. Stupid baselines.",
            "that's what I thought too at first then I checked deeply and realized anxiety is actually protecting me from another depression, which I suffered years ago.   \n\n\nThey so different, two kinds of pain, at the extremes in what doctor Paul calls negative emotion spectrum; anxiety is met by doing what we fear (courage), depression is met by getting our needs fulfilled (well-being)",
            "i feel you and same :|",
            "I fucking feel this so much. Anxiety is the worst, it has an effect on every single thing in my life.",
            "Fuck I feel this. Good luck homey.",
            "dude thank you. I feel so bad sometimes that supposed I wish I struggled more with depression and apathy than I did anxiety. The two unfortunately are quite linked.",
            "Most relatable thing I\u2019ve read in a while",
            "Depression is the sadness and inner voice telling me no one wants me around and they're better off without me. It's the overwhelmed feeling of hopelessness about the world. Anxiety is the racing thoughts etc. I could go on and on. Both are shitty. Is have both. Depression comes and goes for me but it's shit. If I could choose one I'd take anxiety.",
            "I was thinking about this today too\n\nSending you a nice big hug <3",
            "Oh honey, I have both. Have had both at the same time. You can have my depression anytime I\u2019ll keep my anxiety .",
            "I relate to this so much",
            "I'm different. I'd prefer the other way around. Though it's harder and tiring to get anxious all the time but when I'm depressed, I get to think about these suicidal thoughts like I get the strength to do it without feeling anything. It scares me so, no. But don't worry, that was before though, I already overcame those thoughts! Still anxious but it's okay.",
            "i\u2019ve said this to myself for years. my anxiety is so bad that i can\u2019t even sit downstairs with my family to eat dinner. i can\u2019t even be in a room with them when they\u2019re all in the room. even though depression is is a shit, horrible, frustrating illness, i\u2019d prefer it over anxiety any day of the week. anxiety is there 24/7 whereas  my depression comes every couple of weeks for a few days. i\u2019d rather have no mental illness tbh :(",
            "I prefer the anxiety, I've been stuck with it for many years and it's not too bad, at least I can be happy, now I've been diagnosed with depression, im always just sad now a lot and I just want to kill myself",
            "I thought the exact same thing when I started getting bad anxiety. I was like dam depressions easy, go get sunlight, eat some food, exercise and you'll be okay with depression. Anxiety is a fucking terrible thing to try and calm.",
            "That's a tough one for me. I'd say it depends on the moment. \n\nWhen I was extremely depressed for a few years, I just wanted to be able to feel. Like, sometimes I'd have a smile on my face while doing something, or someone would ask on a good day \"how are you feeling?\" and I'd say \"pretty good\" except it was all just surface level, and deep down I just felt empty. \n\nThankfully, I've gotten out of the depressive rut. But it made me remember the anxiety that got me into it in the first place, and now I deal with anxiety constantly. It's a much more active battle, and a lot of days, I just want to go back to the depression, but I know that that would just make everything worse. \n\nIt's a one or the other type deal for me, and depression is just easier since you just don't have anything to fight off in your head, you just sit empty.",
            "I consider this the \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d state. More commonly known as \u201cwhys my mom pissed off at me\u201d",
            "Anxiety is the worst feeling. It's near impossible to fight. while depression lasts longer it's not as intense of a feeling than anxiety.",
            "I understand what you mean. Anxiety feels like paralyzing terror. It's constant. Constant fear and worry about every little thing. It stops me from doing a lot in life. But I'd rather just feel nothing.. and be emotionless and feel no anxiety so I could do things without fear.",
            "i deadass thought i was the only one who thought this...",
            "I thought that too, until depression started telling me to kill myself",
            "I prefer my sadness over my mania 10/10 glad I\u2019m not the only one.",
            "I agree, I hate always feeling worked up and anxious. I would much rather just live in indifference.",
            "100% I suffered from and still do (though not as much) severe depression for my whole life. Didn't have much anxiety until the past roughly 2yrs. And the anxiety is so much worse. Sometimes I miss being depressed because it would mean I don't have to deal with the debilitating anxiety I do most days. Something about feeling numb is much better than feeling nauseous, jittery, and scared of everything.",
            "Me too. \nWhen I used to just get depressed,  I got so much sleep.  Now that anxiety has taken over,  I don't sleep at all.",
            "im the opposite. ive been depressed for so long i dont remember what its like to have motivation. at least i can channel the anxiety into something productive",
            "This is exactly how I\u2019m feeling at the moment.",
            "I kind of disagree, I agree the Anxiety feels like a storm, but Depression comes with Depersonalization, at least for me. I feel like an empty shell with no motivation to do things I like, at all. At least with Anxiety my OCD kicks in and I can do all the things to keep my mind off stuff. \n\nI've been way to depressed lately.",
            "Sadly same. While depressuons is an overall feeling for me, it doesn't affect me too much physically besides 0 energy, sometimes (not a lot) chest pain from crying, and just overall drowsiness, anxiety affects me majorly physically. The pain that can feel like a heart attack, the sweating, the shaking, the lack of sleep, it just makes things worse.\n\n\nHaving both sucks ass cuz one makes me wanna sleep all the time, but one keeps me awake all the damn time.",
            "Man I can identify with this... when the girl I  thought was the love of my life broke up with me years ago I'd have days of just feeling numb and feeling nothing was soooo much better than the anguish and hurt I normally felt",
            "I feel this way too. My SSRIs have done nothing for my anxiety but improved my depression. I guess that\u2019s good, but I just constantly anxious now. At least the depression used to take up some of the anxiety\u2019s space",
            "I really relate to this right now. Im so fucking anxious with so much work to do, but I\u2019m getting nothing done instead, just paralyzed. Ah, the anxiety/stress cycle.",
            "Agree.. anxiety can be so exhausting sometimes.",
            "same here dude",
            "Same so much. Fuck anxiety",
            "\"I didn't go to work for a month \n\nI didn't leave my bed for eight days straight \n\nI haven't hung out with anyone \n\nIf I did, I'd have nothing to say \n\nI didn't feel angry or depressed \n\nI didn't feel anything at all\"",
            "I have mixed feeling on this one. Typically when I reach the point that you're talking about I've become pretty resigned and my body is basically physically and mentally devastated to the point that I'm kind of numb.",
            "They both suck.",
            "This post is giving me a bunch of unwanted emotions idk even know what to do with myself right now omg",
            "I feel the same way! I\u2019ve had depression since I was a kid, but anxiety for only about 4 years. It\u2019s all so new to me still and I find depression easier to handle and manage. Also I feel like whatever I can do to help with my depression makes anxiety worse and vice versa. It\u2019s really hard having both at the same time.",
            "It feels like I wrote this lol. I relate!",
            "I've found with anxiety you can still function better to some extent, because although its horrendous you can still ride that energy and get things done. It can also sometimes springboard you into taking the action you need for a positive step.\n\nThe burn out following anxiety can be misinterpreted as depression. After having a panic attack, after very strenuous exercise, and perhaps to less a relatable extent the next day after drinking often my brain just slows down massively and suddenly I'm content and able to just watch TV, or sit down and do nothing. This is a nice feeling. The same feeling can be triggered after a week of intense anxiety.\n\nDepression when it gets to the point of sheer dread to do even the most basic things is the difference. I.e. washing your clothes becomes the only thing you can handle that day and even that's a challenge. It's not the lack of motivation it's the impending sense of dread to do even the most basic of things, couple that with other associative symptoms of extreme sadness, guilt,low self esteem and suicidal ideology i would say depression is worse.\n\nTLDR: \n\nDepression: Nothing to harness for positive action, paralysis \n\nAnxiety: Can still harness for positive action, and ride the waves of adrenaline to get things done/function.",
            "I must agree. I remember being in the hospital paralyzed and I had anxiety. I thought I know why I\u2019m paralyzed but I can\u2019t wrap my head around anxiety. To me it\u2019s not knowing why, how to get it to go away, will it go away. I can make it worse by going over it. It\u2019s so scary and depression is so sad, but it\u2019s more tolerable, for me. I hope you feel better soon.",
            "Depression is very calming, even if it is a very unhealthy coping mechanism. If I didn\u2019t have people to help me out of it I would probably have sunk into total depression a while ago.",
            "I feel the same way. Currently going through some rough anxiety days and frankly I\u2019d prefer to go back to apathetically molding myself to the couch and sleeping all day than dealing with my spiraling thoughts and endless fidgeting.",
            "I totally understand how you are feeling. Anxiety can be so debilitating and depression is just kinda numbness. I think part of you feeling better may not only be depression - it can also just be you needed to give yourself a break and not put pressure on things that didn\u2019t need that much pressure! You deserve to relax and let yourself not care about stressors for a while. Maybe adding in some things that you enjoy doing/ people you like seeing could alleviate some of the depression too \u2764\ufe0f",
            "This post resonated with me. I hate anxiety because anxiety for me is fear of the unknown, and I hate anxiety. Depression is me focusing on something that I know is true and cannot change. I have dealt with depression a lot better than I have with my anxiety.",
            "i disagree. clinical depression is by far the worst thing that i have ever experienced. color completely leaves your life. your limbs feel like 1000 pounds. it physically hurts doing absolutely anything. nothing has meaning. nothing. \n\ni\u2019d take a panic attack over being a shell of myself any day.",

            "Thanks u",
            "It's the opposite for me. \n\nWhile under lockdown, I actually prefer anxiety because there's no added threat of going out and life's pretty predictable for me so it isn't too bad right now anyway. When I get anxious at home I can usually channel it into being productive and just not stopping to give myself time to overthink. At night it can get pretty bad but I also feel like my thoughts are more profound and interesting when I'm high strung and anxious. \n\nBut then when I'm feeling depressed it's just nothing, I can't get anything done, it later fuels my anxiety because I feel like I've wasted all this time,  and I just hate it.",
            "Hmm interesting- I\u2019m going through bad anxiety right now and thought I preferred it to depression, because with depression there\u2019s barely any will to live cause you can feel nothing, but with anxiety I still WANT to do things and laugh etc it\u2019s just I\u2019m afraid and worried all the time",

This is how my therapist explained it all to me. \n\nAlso, my big issue is a life changing thing that\u2019s going to be hard but the right thing.

I have a few ways it happens but it's always horrible, I agree depression makes you feel numb and the anxiety just wears you out after. I wish I had the courage to go to a doctor or something about it all, I've been like this for far too long now.\n\nI do sometimes get looming thoughts of suicide \ud83d\ude22\n\nI hate that I'm like this it's all down to one person in my past that left me with many mental scars",

Holy shit this stuff makes reality REAL again. Yeah, it can kinda sting in its obvious ways, but at least you feel *human* now. Its the thrill of everything grabbing your face and fucking pushing it up against the window pane of reality, that cocktail of \"wake the fuck up reality's here\", that's just so fascinating to me.",

Sometimes when I\u2019m depressed I\u2019m still functional, and during those times it\u2019s tolerable. But a lot of the time I\u2019m not functional and I just sit in the corner of my living room all day thinking about all of the things I need to do but don\u2019t have the energy for. That being said, I recently realized that I think I\u2019ve been depressed for so long that it\u2019s my new normal, and it\u2019s only when I slip into a deeper depression that I fully notice the feeling of emptiness and profound sadness that consumes me to the point where it\u2019s barely tolerable. Better days will come, just as they have in the past, but I have no doubt that mental health will be a lifelong battle for me.",
            "Completely agree. Depression sucks but it is so much easier to handle for me compared to the living hell of anxiety.",

It has changed me a lot. \n\nFortunately I have really great friends who are willing to plan around my comfort level, but I still miss out on a lot. I guess the questionable upside of having depression is that I don't really care most of the time.",

I wish I could be just depressed (not the painful myriad of emotions, but feeling nothing) having both depression and anxiety at same time is the worst.",
            "I agree, with anxiety there is at least some vitality in it, the energy makes me feel alive; episodes of depression just suck all my energy out and leave me feeling void. For some reason feeling like I might pass out and not being able to catch my breath is preferable than dejectedly staring into the ceiling and feeling nothing. Plus with anxiety I can feel like I can distract myself from it fairly well now, depression just lingers around everything I do when I\u2019m in it, no matter what I do.",
            "I completely agree. With anxiety I can develop tools and strategies to cope/ignore and get on with my life. Depression is just utter hopelessness which is just awful and what\u2019s the point... anxiety is definitely better.",

Everybody\u2019s experience is different, and every new depressive episode may be different than previous.\n\nI feel like my depression is evolving like a virus, every new depression is different. The way I coped few years ago is not working today. It is hard. I have overcome suicidal depression in February, then I thought it was the worst. Then my anxiety took its place. My anxiety is filled with flashbacks and traumatic memories, I have no escape of them as I have chronic nightmares too. That depression episode is not comparable to this anxiety episode. They are both horrible in a different way. Today I feel somewhat happy, because I am not suicidal and I am not having panic attacks. Gotta appreciate these days :)",
            "Yes, that\u2019s how I feel! Predominantly I suffer from anxiety and have all my life, but because of that I\u2019ve learned how to help it when it\u2019s at its worst etc. plus even though anxiety can be a \u2018deer in the headlights\u2019 kind of paralysing...I can still feel, and I can calm myself down....I can help it.\n\nDepression hit me like a ton of bricks last year...I\u2019ve always had some inklings of it, but last year it hit hard. It wasn\u2019t anxiety with occasional hints of depression, it was full blown depression and I\u2019ve never felt so hopeless....I just couldn\u2019t do anything. Couldn\u2019t make myself feel anything...I hope I never go down that hole again.. :/",
            "I'm exactly the same!! Depression at least comes with tiredness. Anxiety is extremely stressful",
            "Yeah, I am always worried something is wrong with my heart. I found out about precordial catch syndrome, and it lessened my anxiety over heart issues. But still sometimes I have this strange feeling of suddenly realizing that my heart is a raw flesh pumping blood through my veins, and somehow I start to feel how blood rushes through my tickling veins to my fingertips. Very uncomfortable feeling.",
            "Last week I started journaling my panic/anxiety attacks. In 7 days I had 19 entries. If you ask me now how was my week I would answer terrible, but without journaling I would have answered \u2018I don\u2019t know, guess I am okay, cuz today was okay\u2019. Every once in a while I would feel okay (like I do right now), and I would totally not remember the week I had, and all the anxiety just blurs into past.",

You don\u2019t really share or question it, then one day you realize it was not normal. For example, it turns out I have been having some kind of panic attacks all this times, but movies display panic attacks differently than I experience them. In march I was sick with a respiratory issues and was having shortness of breath and heart palpitations, then it struck me - it was what I casually experienced without respiratory issues when anxiety hits me. It is totally not normal to feel lightheaded and frozen on a daily basis, now it feels so obvious.",
            "Do you also have extreme empathy when anxious to the point of not being able to watch or read new things, and having safe activities? And also stop feeling emotions fully when detached and depressed? When \u2018bleh\u2019 I really miss emotions, but when anxiety opens the gates of the emotions it is a flood? Also there are depressions that bring unbearable sadness and deep emotions, as well as anxiety that paralyzes emotions?",
            "True",
            "Yep, and then get so anxious that fall into a paralysis like state, and then become hopeless and more depressed?",
            "Yeah, sometimes I hypothetically think about a scenario when I magically wake up with amnesia, but full of energy to rediscover myself. Can you believe there are people who are free of chronic anxiety, and maybe free of clinical depression too. I forget about it constantly and always project my experiences to others.",
            "Yeah, it goes to the point of second guessing the reality. Then the blanks in memory, I do not remember last months clearly.",
            "I do not know, some of my anxious thought can be traces back to roots. Other times anxiety has no thoughts, it is just there, like some kind of a primal fear. It is hard to work on an anxiety when it has no faces. I hope later this week I will get prescribed something that will ease this constant state of fear and dread.",
            "At 120mph it is not even racing thoughts, it is more of a foggy brain, and you cannot even rationalize your anxiety, or even meditate. 12mph is far easier to ride out than 120mph",
            "Energy wise anxiety is more taxing for me. But while depressed I do not have energy to begin with.",
            "Yeah, for me with anxiety there are more physical symptoms that make everything worse, and you constantly listen to your body and worry. While depressed I do not care enough to even care about my health.\n\nWith anxiety I am confined in my aching body and anxious thoughts and dreams, disconnected from\nsurrounding. With depression I am mostly escaping in my thoughts and dreams, also disconnected.",
            "Maybe you should try different meds? Maybe the next one's won't make you feel that way",
            "Yeah, it is like turning the switch from caring about everything too much to not caring at all. I hope mine will remain for a day or two more to get a break and rest from anxiety.",
            "Yep, and when you lay there immobilized with loss of hope and dread, somehow your brain pulls it together and filled with anxiety you start to run around being somewhat productive. Then you burn out from the amount of energy you just burst through, into the depression, now different kind?",
            "With depression I am much familiar and have been unbelievably low few times, but long anxiety episodes with panic attacks scare me the most. They feel like a torture with hot iron rods. Everything you potentially fear gets a substance with anxiety, the visuals and extreme emotional state is very unpredictable.",
            "How do ya deal with it? I started taking notes on my anxiety which gives me a perspective on it when I am stable enough to read through. Started therapy, soon will try prescription meds hopefully. Meditation works only if it is a mild anxiety not deep into anxiety episode. Anything more to try?",
            "Well said!",
            "Yep, anxiety makes me self isolated in a shorter time than depression. They both suck and the result is the same at the end. I hope you get well, really.",
            "Yeah, on depression you can somehow function, even mask it well and go through stress with apathy, but when anxiety hits you are barely functioning because even slightest stress shakes your entire life?",
            "Good luck for you too! It feels like all the damned cards are already pulled",
            "Yeah, personal hell, specifically made to torture in every way possible, also evolving with us and getting smarter.",

            "Objectively, depression and anxiety both sucks, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, feels better. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and maybe find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy, or whatever you are meaning to do or to start. And change that baseline of feeling good higher.",
            "That\u2019s true also, it is what outweighs at the moment feels like the worst of the two. Objectively depression and anxiety both sucks. I hope you get well soon, hugs",
            "Yeah, the combo is terrible. In uni I used to go without sleep 2 days due to anxiety and heart palpitations, then sleep a full day after recharging. When started to work I was so tired of anxiety I had insomnia all workdays with serious anxiety, then not leave my bed on weekends. One time I believe I have slept almost an entire week only waking up to drink an orange juice and sat a toast. \n\nI wish I could get help before all of this.",
            "Well I hope I will find a good med combo soon. I need a crutch yo get back on my feet. Is your anxiety productive or paralyzing?",
            "Yeah seems to be anxiety can be both motivating enough to be productive as well as totally paralyzing.",
            "Yep the change from panic attacks to numbness feels easier. But it is not normal, depression should not be a baseline. And those changes are what made me postpone therapy, \u2018Oh, never mind, I feel better now\u2019. But then it is not better.",
            "Maybe if you tell me more about what you are feeling we can ride it out together?",
            "Good for you for managing anxiety into productivity, I wish you to maintain this balance further!",
            "I guess it is just what outweighs at the moment.",
            "Yep maybe it is the change from one bad state to other state that sucks a bit less, that makes me feel better. But do not get tricked, depression should not be the baseline for anxiety and vice versa. At the end they both make us a shadow of ourselves.",
            "I feel you, I have finally got a great supply for painting but cannot start. I have bought online courses that are just sitting there. Both the anxiety and depression suck, at the end you are a broken shell of yourself. Hope you feel better soon and try that new pedal you mentioned!",
            "Yeah it can be, thinking back what I perceive as mania or burst of energy was anxiety fueled productivity. I believe thanks to anxiety I did finish my uni, otherwise I was a suicidal mess. Then anxiety showed its more ugly face. Heh",
            "That is the most relateable thing I have read. Thank you for the analogy.",
            "Anxiety is like seeing a massive tornado coming your way, depression is like seeing all the damage after it\u2019s gone. At least that\u2019s how I feel.",
            "Only if the storm destroyed everything what is important in your live",
            "Anxiety is like having 50 demons pushing your head underwater. You can't stop them and somehow feel like you deserve it.",
            "Y\u2019all make me jealous.  Just kidding I hope all is well or improving \ud83d\udda4",
            "I feel you and I am with you. Anxiety is absolutely exhausting. Those who never experience anxiety or have anxiety disorders will never know what it's like to feel like it's a constant battle, constant stress.",
            "How did you find out a damaged nerve was the cause? And how could I get myself checked for something similar?",
            "[deleted]",
            "I understand totally. Thankfully panic attacks are few and far between for me now. My anxiety was triggered by people who moved in right next door to me 7 years ago. Horrendous people who made life a living hell. The anxiety got so bad I had a breakdown and ended up quitting my job because I couldn't cope. The neighbours were finally evicted in December after a long battle, and things have been feeling easier all around. The paranoia is still there but it's just not as bad. But I remember being triggered so very easily and would go into panic even at the sound of a door slamming. It was awful. \n\nI really hope things get easier for you. I still have a long way to go, but I hope you will get to this point too where you feel like you can enjoy things again.",
            "Do you know the core of the anxiety and what triggers you? I know it's not easy to deal with, by any means. There is a method of focusing on something else, I used to try it and it would make help distract me for a few minutes, but didn't always work. I think it's a matter of research and finding what works. Medication can help.",
            "I'm exactly in the same boat right now",
            "You\u2019re not alone. :(",
            "Sorry to hear that, man.  I\u2019ve had suicidal ideations, but I haven\u2019t yet been to the point of considering actually doing it.  I always just think of how that would mess up my kids for life and that is enough (right now) to keep me far enough away from it that I feel like I\u2019m relatively safe.\n\nGlad you are having a good day today though.",
            "Thank you, that's very kind, and I wish the same to you! Allow yourself to rest and be gentle. You'll make it through \ud83d\ude0a",
            "My brother in law was 40 years old when he found out that it's not \"normal\" to be terrified to enter an unfamiliar building! Once I just accepted my mental health struggles, and got comfortable talking about it with my friends and family, life got so much easier to cope with.",
            "i am a huge empath, and yes all the stuff going on the world is becoming extremely overwhelming. i have always had anxious tendencies but now it is allll the time. and yes you are right with depression bringing deep feelings. but i feel more in control of those feelings, if that makes any sense",
            "I don't know, there were times I just wished I could feel anything at all. Then in the moments I did it was just panic, but somehow it made me feel alive. For the exhaustion too, tiredness after anxiety still had my mind buzzing so that I could somehow drag myself to do things because I'd feel worse not doing them, whereas from depression I just couldn't pick myself up from the bed at all, like deep under a quicksand any motion would be too hard. I wonder if the one we \"prefer\" has to do with which is the more prevalent one, as the other becomes the \"relief\"?",
            "Yeah I think I\u2019m with you there. At least we aren\u2019t alone with mental illness, thank god.",
            "It surprises me so much whenever I hear someone talking about not having really any mental illnesses and feeling generally happy and depression-free. It's strange to remember there are some people who wouldn't even think they'd have any reason to be depressed and are super optimistic about their life, I just can't imagine how that would be like. How different would my life be if I never had anxiety and depression?",
            "I\u2019m scared to trust my own memory a lot of the time, and I become mistrustful of other people because my anxiety makes me think everyone hates me and everything they do for me is either a lie or a burden.",
            "I was quite untrustful of meds in the first place, don't like artificially fixing things, I'd much rather go through the therapy and the talks with my psych to minimize it and get some great coping mechanisms\n\nSo I'm fine with how things are now, even taking small baby steps every day in getting out of my anxious circlejerking",
            "Yes, that's exactly what its like.",
            "I am the biggest mess in this planet trust me, I feel like I\u2019m sitting on my own in a blank space looking at nothing, I haven\u2019t learnt to cope with any of the two yet, I constantly cry all week, shut myself in my room, dont talk to friends or parents... so I can\u2019t help you with that haha, it\u2019s like I wanna get better but something inside is like nah stay as you are, you fine.",
            "Of course",
            "I can get new ones anytime babe. Brand new ones. There\u2019s no shortage. I\u2019ll send a catalog.",
            "Thank you, you too.",
            "Definitely paralyzing, which is unfortunate. We\u2019ll all get to a place where we can cope eventually right?",
            "Idek tbh. I've felt so numb and empty, I haven't even realized it for a few years, that its been my \"normal\"",
            "Thank you man. All i needed was some sleep and ive hit the fretboard today. Building up some callouses and ill definitely play more \n\nHope you do weol with painting.\nIm so done with health anxiety.\nIf it really is my time to die, my Lord will give it to me",
            "Yeah this feels a bit more accurate to me than calling it the \u201ccalm after the storm.\u201d More like the \u201ccleanup after the storm\u201d that you can\u2019t do anyways because you\u2019re too tired and depressed and then all of a sudden you have dirty dishes that have been in the sink for 3 months.\n\nedit: a word",
            "Absolutely. It really wipes you out, doesn't it? What people don't realise is the amount of energy it saps from your core. The paranoia, panic attacks, constant worry, always on edge, overthinking everything. It really is exhausting. Then you just wanna try and sleep (good luck to that lol, hello 4:52am) because you just don't have the motivation to do anything else. It's a vicious circle.",
            "I was doing perfectly fine, when I felt a sharp burn in my stomach, I felt it literally melting. When anti anxiety meds didn\u2019t work, my psychiatrist referred me to a neurologist, and I did a CT scan, MRI and biopsy.",

            "Thank god I live in an age of internet. When I was a kid and a teenager, I thought something was really wrong with me. There was no awareness of mental health around me, I am so glad I can read other people\u2019s experiences and just feel normal for a while.",

            "This was me with weed. Starting out, I loved my high. I was creative, things were funnier, etc. Years of routine pot smoking made me socially anxious along with panic attacks and when I finally sobered up, it made me depressed. \n\nI felt like an outsider bc my friends could smoke and just go throughout their day to day.. work, class, gym, not me\u2026 Substances affect people differently \u2014 including alcohol. Kicked the habit years ago and haven\u2019t looked back.",
            "I also drink sometimes and I feel it does a lot for my anxiety while drinking and even the day after. It makes me feel free and even a little more happy for the moment. But honestly I feel there's a rebound effect. Afterwards it always feels like my anxiety got a little worse and it takes some days for me to feel like getting back to my ' normal' anxiety level.",
            "Yeah idk i just never experienced that something good happens out of being drunk... u say things u won't say normally, you feel like absolute shit the next couple days, i get depersonalization attacks sometimes, allways drama involved... so i drink like 3 beers at max and thats it",
            "It's because of anxiety that I've never been drunk before lmao. 'Losing control' of myself sounds like the worst thing ever, and on top of that it would most likely make me anxious too",
            "I have quit drinking alcohol and caffeine because of my anxiety. I can't say that it is the sole reason my anxiety has improved, but I know that those substances have made my anxiety worse, so I avoid them.",

            "I\u2019ve noticed it can trigger it. So I make a point of never drinking for emotional needs or coping with stress. Try to keep it strictly to social drinkin\u2019.",
            "I very rarely drink, especially at home because I am scared I will become an alcoholic. It's both the loss of control, but also the fact that my anxiety \"disappears\" when I drink and I am scared of being addicted to that feeling of being anxiety free.",
            "I don\u2019t dare since alcoholism runs in my family, and I tend to cope with my mental health issues in unhealthy ways sometimes. I don\u2019t wanna get addicted, so I simply don\u2019t drink. The feeling of loosing control is also scary. There is other reasons too though, I don\u2019t think I enjoy that stuff much anyway.",
            "I don't like drinking or being high because the altered mindset feels like a loss of control",
            "I found myself needing to be buzzed around the clock to keep anxiety at bay\u2026 as others stated, I drank to help ease anxiety but the alcohol caused worse anxiety as the buzz was wearing off. And it turns out that a constant buzz puts your blood alcohol level really really high. I was in a horrible cycle. Tried to stop but had seizures. Went to detox and AA for an every day reminder of why I couldn\u2019t drink. That was nearly 7 years ago, and I\u2019ve never looked back. I see a weekly therapist and practice breathing and other healthy avenues.",
            "Me ^_^  \n  \nI used to drink a lot back in my early 20s. I quit because weed was better at managing my depression/anxiety.",

            "I stopped drinking alcohol completely 10 years ago because I was prescribed Xanax.  (psa don\u2019t stay on benzos long term). And because I didn\u2019t even like the feeling of being drunk.  Alcohol is the most overrated drug.  You booze you lose.",
            "Alcohol gives me sensory overload, so I don\u2019t drink. Maybe only once a year I\u2019ll have a can of beer, but that\u2019s it.",

            "Drinking causes anxiety. Edibles are safe though if they are legal in your state. They can also stop the drinking cravings. You\u2019ll just eat a bunch of food but I suppose food would not give you anxiety! So that\u2019s the safest bet.",

            "I don\u2019t drink alcohol or caffeine. Stopped it all. Don\u2019t miss either. Alcohol actually makes my heart flutter/palpitate and I\u2019ve learned to hate the way I feel on it. Caffeine makes my heart pound and makes me shaky and anxious. \n\nI was never a big drinker of either but just realized that it just wasn\u2019t really worth doing either anymore.",
            "I do t drink pr smoke anymore because I like to being sober..Its the best to feel your body at 100% and not being under any effect",
            "Yep! I rarely drink any more because it makes\nMy anxiety worse",
            "I drink almost daily, lightly imo to keep the anxiety down. Now if I get really drunk and wake up with a hangover then my anxiety skyrockets and HR stays between 120-135 for a majority of the day And I dread it so much. Also THC I have to careful with and only use 1:1s and up because even straight 5mg THC edible will make my heart rate go way up with no high given, been smoking for about 10 years and the tables turned on me and can't smoke bud of carts anymore.",
            "Yeah I like drinking but can\u2019t do it if I\u2019ve been mentally vulnerable. The alcohol comedowns almost put me in the ground.",
            "I drink to rid myself of anxiety sometimes. Depression never goes away. Truthfully id rather live with the depression rather than the debilitating anxiety lmao",
            "I used to drink because it helped my anxiety but about 2 months ago my anxiety got so bad so I quit alcohol along with nicotine and caffeine.",
            "I have never drank, combination of anxiety/depression, and growing up with people with alcohol dependence who became angry or suicidal when drinking. I live in the UK so there's a huge drinking culture over here. All my old friends wanted to do was go out drinking so I lost all them, and now basically every work gathering revolves around alcohol so I never go out with them either. The loneliness then just exacerbates the anxiety.",
            "I don\u2019t drink alcohol cause the feeling after it wears off (either the day itself or the day after) makes me feel depressed and suicidal. It\u2019s not worth the \u201chigh\u201d",
            "Yes it\u2019s a horrible circle to get into and easily can get into a rut. Have Anxiety \u2014>Drink Alcohol\u2014> Hanxiety for days\u2014>Drink to cure that Anxiety\u2014>Back to start. Alcohol is one of the best cures for anxiety but you get into an awful rut with it. I\u2019ve cut out alcohol completely and only then I\u2019ve realised how bad my mental health is. I also gone a celiac diet which in itself is very healthy so have no regrets just eating fresh meat, potatoes, Rice and veg for all meals along. My gut health is improving week by week.",
            "I used to drink heavily because of anxiety. It worked. \n\nThen it stopped working. And I was anxious because of the drinking. \n\nSo I completely quit, years ago. And cigarettes. \n\nAnd now I\u2019m fat and depressed \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 (joking - but I am a little overweight)",
            "I've once had a very bad episode of depression (heart break) that prevented me from drinking water for 3 days. 3 days, no water. I think I could have gone on if the therapist didn't give me a glass of water and asked me to drink it in front of her.\nI realise it was very dangerous but back then I just wanted the pain to go away.",

            "Yes, it can. I'm currently on day 5 sobar and lookikg forward to day 6. Min by min I go. I do not like being panicky and anxious. it's. Terrible feeling for me",
            "Wow what happened with the thc?",
            "Absolutely. Someone bought me weed from Colorado as a gift last time, but had to decline because even the slightest bit of THC puts me in a full on neurotic spiral with really negative thoughts. With alcohol too, I just stick to craft beer. Cutting nicotine absolutely helped, as someone who used to smoke hookah and the occasional cigarette on weekends. Coffee is something that I still love though. That together with L-theanine has been great for me.",

            "Yeah. Drinking feels fine in the moment but it\u2019s the after.\n\nI don\u2019t drink that much but even one little drink and I mean little will effect me. Sometimes I don\u2019t get anxiety the day after. but sometimes I do",
            "[removed]",
            "I did this for the first couple weeks.\n\nKept the alcohol and caffeine out. Kept sugar reasonable and cut gluten but added back gluten free grains just to keep food costs in check. Been a big improvement to my physical wellbeing and im certain its improved my mental health compared to what it could have been had i not made the change",
            "Mind sharing how your QOL improved?  I cut out alcohol almost a year ago after learning from my doctor that my heavy drinking was a way of self-medicating for anxiety.   I haven't attempted caffeine or sugar, though.",

            "Because they are full of sugar. Sugar is the worst thing you can consume",
            "Couple of reasons for me. Note this is all pseudo reasoning but...\n\nSweeteners are both unhealthy in abundance (especially when trying to lose weight) and can have a rollercoaster effect on your mind.\n\nCarbonation creates gas in your stomach which can result in reflux or simply burping. Burping commonly makes you feel less full and can lead to over eating. (Competitive eaters use this method to open up more space for food in the stomach).\n\nMost carbonated drinks, especially pop has caffeine which doesnt help mental health as it excites your mind which can lead to a panic attack/heightened stress.\n\nI was addicted to carbonated drinks and would easily drink a dozen cans of whatever 'sugar free' drink a day. That shit is expensive and uneeded.",
            "I've been off caffeine for almost 17 years, it definitely helped",
            "Certainly has helped. I actually get solid sleeps now (when im not having an anxiety episode, which is unrelated).\n\nAlso i feel better when i wake up/early morning as im not craving the caffeine",

I drove to the nearest firehouse and my heart rate was double normal rate. I was writhing in pain. I've tried it since then and still can't tolerate it. I've tried bud and lower thc but it still sends me into panic. Sucks because I used it to help me sleep but meditating helps now. Saves me a lot of money though, lol.",
            "It\u2019s rough for sure. I don\u2019t understand people drinking until they blackout. Literally how can that be fun. Maybe a bit of my anxiety disorder is kinda good, in that it prevents me from drinking, so that I don\u2019t destroy my liver",

If the anxiety centers around your fear or concern about symptoms themselves as with health anxiety, your mind will play tricks on you and mimic whatever condition you\u2019re concerned about. In my own experience, I wasn\u2019t fatigued or sick until it turned into generalized anxiety and was no longer so much about panic disorder. I got a yucky an indescribable feeling. In my own experience, the whole thing was caused by my own preocupation with my health.",

So weird, but yeah\u2026",
            "Absolutely. This past year, my anxiety was the absolute worst it has ever been. I was having panic attacks almost daily, unmedicated, and my immune system went to complete shit.

There are more serotonin receptors in the gut and the brain. \n\nThe gut is also affected by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. This is why disturbance of the mind can absolutely cause disturbance of the gut, including symptoms like abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nSometimes, when you get that 'uneasy feeling,' and you can't quite place what is bothering you, you may experience abdominal pain, sweating, or diarrhea. \n\nToxic people may make you feel that way, too. You may experience abdominal symptoms before consciously understanding what is bothering you. \n\n**That is why there is truth to the saying 'trust your gut.'** \n\nYour gut, respiratory system, and heart may also be telling you something. \n\nPanic attacks may be your unconscious telling you something is wrong and it is time to change direction. \n\nYour bladder also sends you messages, such as frequent urination and bed wetting, which can be a sign of emotional disturbance. So can your skin, outbreak, acne, and hives can definitely be a source of stress or emotional disturbance. \n\nNot just your gut but all the organs in your body are speaking to you in their way, and it is important to listen.",

(Think of the scene in Steel Magnolias where Sally Field gives Julia Roberts orange juice.) Similarly, your mention of oatmeal is a bit suspicious to me because oats have a low GI score \u2013\u00a0meaning they help regulate blood sugar and avoid spikes and dips, so \"helping you feel normal\" would make sense if you have something like hypoglycemia or reactive hypoglycemia.",

I took an attempt on my life the day I got it (due to other reasons) and woke up 3 days later in hospital, so I didn't suffer with it too much. I had it for the first time last October and it took me weeks to recover. It annoys me when people deny it exists. Hope you're ok too \u2764\ufe0f",

            "Get checked out for hypoglycemia. But bear in mind that with anxiety disorder you get super sensitive to any changes in your body. The slightest relief of any kind, eating, resting, will make you think it\u2019s just a matter of taking care of your body or finding some emotional relief when the real culprit (not saying this is your case) has more to do with how you view and interpret the physical sensations themselves. Feeling physically well is a big part of recovery, but not the whole thing. I was always discovering a new solution that quickly wore out. I became convinced it was a calcium deficiency because I read that calcium sucks up lactic acid, no I needed a neurochemical called GABBA, then it was some hidden unknown childhood trauma. That just made me more depressed. (Do get therapy however) I knew damn well that it all started when I became obsessed with my heart because I had a bad reaction to cough medicine and alcohol. Why was I looking for a nutritional or psychoanalytic solution when it was my own suggestion of a physical problem that wasn\u2019t there? However, I will say gastrointestinal issues are a bonafide response to anxiety.",
            "Thanks for the insight! My professional background has more to do with the psychology of GAD rather than the physiological responses to it. Fortunately, I don't have any medical issues with blood sugar, but anxiety could be mediating the response itself rather than an issue that stems directly from blood sugar. It is very possible that there are other issues contributing to my body's homeostatic maladies other than anxiety, though.",

I have been able to stay safe as far as i know but I do wonder sometimes.  If you need help getting hold of good respirators or anything like that, please let me know. You can look at my profile and see where else I talk about those things, and join in.\n\nWishing you nothing but the best.",
            "Spend some time doing deep breathing exercises or try to sit outside and focus on what you can hear, see, and smell. Having something else to focus on when I am having an anxious or depressive episode helps me. To help fall asleep I try to leave the TV on or listen to podcasts about a topic I normally enjoy. Music doesn\u2019t always help as it doesn\u2019t provide enough of an escape for me to offset the symptoms I\u2019m feeling. Changing environments like going to the kitchen to grab a small snack and water or sitting on the bathroom floor and steaming up the shower have helped me before too. If you can going on a short walk (even to grab the mail) can help break up focus. Having a pet, friend, or family member around could also help with providing a good distraction or just silent support. \n\nI am not a doctor, I\u2019d encourage seeing one and a mental health professional at your earliest possibility if you haven\u2019t already for anxiety and/or depression. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling this way.

            "Honestly I feel like the depression hits me harder. I\u2019ve had it (actively) for about 16 years now. Problem with that is it started during my developmental years. So my entire personality was in some way influenced by depression. Not to mention the severe memory loss. I have like 16 memories of life from 4 to about two years ago. That\u2019s it. My entire childhood and my teen years are a black hole",

            "I agree. Honestly I'd rather feel depressed and suicidal than feel that impending doom, \"I'm dying right now\" feeling. It's easier to control my thoughts with depression and depression doesn't give me chest pain, racing heart, shaking, numbness/pins and needles and all the other horrid anxiety symptoms. If I had to choose which to love with, I'd choose depression all the way.",
            "Firstly just like to thankyou for posting this. Like most (everyone?) in this thread I am currently suffering from both. And it definitely hits everyone differently. The days where I cannot get out of bed or I just cannot feel anything but a kinda numbness. Depression is worse. But when I am having a panic attack in the bathroom about..... I do not even know, in that moment anxiety is worse. Both make we want run screaming for the hills but for different reasons. If I HAD to pick though. I can always feel my depression, it is always there. I know I have anxiety, but I do not, feel it as much. \n\nAnyway, thankyou for letting me rant.",

            "Having severe ocd, chronic anxiety/depression I gotta say that you can learn how to react to anxious thoughts, and both depression and anxiety will exist at different times and at different measures, but depression requires intense action in the physical world to beat. It's hard to engage in life with depression and for me I have some kind of complex for existing in reality, it seems to take an altered mindset and profound willpower for me to make the steps required to better myself and I just can't flip the switch from a depressed person to a normal one with a life. They are equally bad though and feed into eachother. \n\nIt seems to me that anxiety takes mental techniques and awareness of thoughts to beat while depression takes a devotion to action in life, a profound amount of willpower and for me in particular a profound change in mindset to make the steps to overcome. I feel they are equally distressing but I feel empty when I'm depressed. At least I can quell my anxiety and be aware of the thoughts I need to counteract the anxious ones. Depression makes me feel empty and to defeat it I have flip the switch in my brain from don't live to living and having a life and I feel like I can't because I don't want to live. Ocd anxiety has many times caused intense rage for me and it's highs can be really hard to snap out of, that's when it feels worse and more extreme. Ultimately for me they are the same in magnitude of affliction though. I guess I'm either empty or full of rage and it's hard to keep myself in the gray area.",

Walking around holding my tight chest deciding what to do.\nTook an hour to get myself out of that feeling. And took me years to realize I'm not close to having a heart attack and dying, but just severe anxiety. \n\nI struggle with bad bouts of depression too. I'd take the empty feeling over the dying feeling every time..",
            "Idk. I've had anxiety for far longer and although it was very difficult but I had a life. Even with it being severe, I felt like there was a head on my shoulders and I wasn't totally unreachable when it came to emotional support. There was some hope.\n\nWhen depression got worse, it practically killed me as a person and a couple times almost literally killed me. Cut off people I cared about after no longer feeling for them, cognitive decline, no more interests, basic self-care gone. It's a non-existence that makes it too tempting to end it.",

I remembered when I was a younger teen and my depression was at its total worst it\u2019s like I just didn\u2019t give a shit about anything. I lacked motivation and didn\u2019t personally get much if any satisfaction/enjoyment out of things but at least I could still go out and do things without freaking out. When the depression is better the anxiety gets miles worse. Like I want to go do things, I feel social, I want to actually live, but I just can\u2019t fucking do it. There have been times where I almost weirdly missed(?) my worse days of depression because at least then I could still function in public without feeling horribly sick. It\u2019s so fucked up. I feel relieved that other people feel this too. Good luck everyone, I love you all <3",

I would find myself thinking about dying,  killing myself, how I would do it, etc., and then realize what I was thinking, and I could feel my blood run cold. I was afraid of myself. Not anxious, afraid. I was able to get help before it progressed too far, and I never want to be in that state again. I would much rather be anxious.",

Is a doctor helping you diagnose or is it self diagnosis? Anxiety and depression come in different seventies for each of us and we each have different tolerances this isn't black and white.  Do doctors have you on medication because that can cause mania?  Sorry you're sick and feel better.",
            "yes. so much yes. its the same for me. didnt suffer from anxiety much until a couple of weeks/months ago. i had a panic attack with a trip to the hospital and since then my anxiety phases where quite hard on me. before that it was just something like depression (idk what a therapist would diagnose it but guess thats it. haven't been to a therapist yet. im still on a waiting list). \ndays with depression are much better than anxiety. this so much. some minor things can lead to me worrying and being sxared of death etc. its the worst.",

            "I suppose everyone is different, but my experience is similar to yours. My anxiety is *sooo* much harder to bear. If I could wave a magic wand and instantly get rid of only one of them, I would for sure get rid of my anxiety.",

I have constant anxiety 24/7. I haven't had a moment of calm in 2 years. I can't work, I can barely go outside, I can't sleep, eat or do anything really. I'm not living. My mind is cluttered with negative thoughts like \"I'll never get better. - I can't do this. - It will always be like this.\" and my body physically hurts and I'm terrified all the time. \n\nThough my depression is very severe as well, my anxiety is on another level. It doesn't make me productive or anything, it has completely taken over my life. \n\nSo I 100% agree that anxiety is worse, at least if you have a very high level of anxiety. Though if your anxiety level is a bit lower, depression can feel worse. I guess it depends on each person.",

            "Same. I feel like, as debilitating as anxiety is, it's something I can better understand and actually kind of work through sometimes. My depression is a result of having so much anxiety that my brain shuts down and doesn't wanna deal with it, and that sucks because all u can do then is wait it out.",

She always took my anxiety seriously and didn't say things like it's all in your head like many do. I fell into a very depressive state from January to April just no motivation, no desire to do anything, thoughts of not wanting to be here. I am some better now, not completely out of it but trying.\n\nI've had anxiety for 16 years so probably I just know how to cope with it better and learned to function with it, but I'd take anxiety over depression. But I totally understand someone saying anxiety is worse or they're equally terrible. Mental illness is just not a good time.",
            "Same. When I got depressed in high school, I mistook it for being an introvert. I read a bunch of books on introversion and took pride in being a loner. I didn't even know about depression. It led to me being extremely socially isolated in college which was horrible for my mental health and caused me social anxiety that I am still working on today. It took a few years to realize that while I am an introvert, my symptoms were from depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, my parents, teachers, and doctors didn't recognize my mental illness when I was in school because I was high functioning. Therapy and meds have helped a lot, but I still need to remind myself that my social anxiety is unfounded and make myself socialize instead of avoiding people.",
            "Yeah, me too. Everything until 30 was pretty dark.",

I'm terrified of leaving my bed. I feel horrible physical pain from my constant anxiety.

            "When my anxiety was bad, I couldn't exercise at all. I think it was a \"fight\" response (of fight or flight fame), I used to run lots! my average 10km pace was around 5 min 45 sec, which was pretty decent for me. Once anxiety took over I couldn't run at all, as soon as I'd start running my whole body would just shut down. I'd never get further than 1km and I'd have to give up.    \nIn the end I had to switch from running to intervals, even then I never made it more than 3km.  Eventually I just stopped running.   \nThe same thing happened in spinning class, I just had to stop going because I'd get to a certain point and my body would just stop.   \nI actually caught it once during spinning when we were wearing heart rate monitors, my heart rate went from over 160 bpm to under 50 bpm in a few seconds. It was crazy. I was really happy about that though, because I had actual proof that something was going on, it wasn't just in my head.      \nThat was 4 or 5 years ago.  \nMy anxiety situation has improved a bit recently, and now, weirdly I'm experiencing what you descripe- all of a sudden I'm running 10km again (nowhere near 5.50 pace, but still) and I'm not shutting down.   \nI'm now training 5  times a week and have lost 7kg in the past 3 months.   \nWeird. So all of a sudden now, my anxiety, while much lighter than before, is almost a benefit, whereas before it crippled me.",
            "oh yeah thats true. thats the one thing anxiety has given me. the fear of death has made it quite impossible to kill myself or let myself go. and trying to contain my anxiety does also help my depression.  \nbut i also do think my depression is not as strong as my anxiety maybe.",

For me, the most frightening thing I have been through was when my depression was at its worst, and I found myself thinking of taking my own life. And you can also be depressed and not suicidal. I have not been in that bad of a place in years, but I do still suffer from waves of depression, when I just want to give up. Not die, but give up, move home with my mom, stop working, lay in bed all day, and do nothing. Sometimes I'm also just sad. I don't necessarily feel like giving up, but still feel hopeless, and things feel meaningless. Depression is much more than wanting to die.",

            "Yes it helps I wouldn\u2019t say it will cure your anxiety attacks but if you deal with a lot of stress in general it helps on that. For me I found walking beneficial since I have a dog, I would walk twice a day for 20-30 mins each time.",
            "Yes, and honestly it does more for me than anything else. You must have an actual long term objective and well rounded routine in order for that work. What I mean by that is that every day you need a mix of cardiovascular activity, strength training, STRETCHING (so over looked in most fitness routines), and diet to achieve the desired results. \n\nNotice I didn\u2019t attach any particular method of exercise or time (although that is important too) but WHEN and HOW do matter. The human body is extremely complex and interconnected. One activity has a myriad of impacts to your body and it can go out of balance easily. For me, I found having intentional periods of activity at key intervals of day work best. \n\nI recommend leaning more towards endurance training for cardio, and yoga as it does that as well as provides strength training and wellness in one. By doing both I have come to understand my body well and that I turn has led me to better manage my anxiety. Yoga more so than anything else as the practice has many different faces and isn\u2019t at all about hitting a pose perfectly.\n\nThe practice teaches you how to control your breath and muscles as well as your thoughts as you move (or not if you are doing a restorative based practice which is my jam). By diving all the way in I get better sleep, perform better in cardio routines because I am rarely sore thanks to the practice, and it opened up a world where I was thinking consciously about what was going on in my mind and body. \n\nThis is the most important benefit of fitness when it comes to managing our symptoms. When anxiety pokes its head out your body goes in to a literal tailspin. Once you train your mind and body to the point where you can self regulate this with your conscious mind you can more easily reduce your anxiety. You\u2019ll also sleep better than you ever have.",

            "Yes it really does, i started doing Calisthenics 4 months ago and i feel better than ever, especially after the workout. In my personal experience it's not only the workout that helps, but the goals too. like doing a certain number of reps or mastering a move, it really give you motivation and something to look forward too beside the good feeling from the physical activity itself",
            "Exercising never helped my depression, only therapy did.\n\nBut I will say the exercise I have found to help my mental health the most is yoga. There are several reasons for this. One is it gives you proprioceptive movement which is grounding, but the whole idea about being, allowing yourself to feel, to take up space, to do deep breathing which stimulates the vagus nerve etc.....\n\nI also found that lifting heavy and running (which is what I have been doing for years) gives me great confidence. But I wouldn't say it has cured my anxiety, it's more about the fact that I am great at something that is mine and mine only. And I look good too. \n\nYes, exercise has been proven to have a positive effect on mental health. But don't put all your faith into it. I have litteraly cried at the gym, on a treadmill.

I am stuck in a bad living situation and that paired with my mental health and finances has enabled me to stay isolated and deprived of the outside world. I don't have a car.

            "I started exercising really hard so I don\u2019t have the strength to have panic attacks \ud83d\ude02 no really I feel very good after exercising, the chemicals it releases on our body does wonders.",
            "yes! it honestly helps so much. not only is it fun to see the progress, but it\u2019s nice to know that you\u2019re doing something good for yourself. it also gets me out of the house which is nice.",
            "Well, now I\u2019m on a medication, but I was basically using exercise to combat my severe panic attacks for the last year. Basically if I went to the gym 4-5 days/week and did at least a few substantial cardio workouts per week I\u2019d notice major relief. If I ever missed more than 3 days I\u2019d go right back to severe panic episodes. So for me while it did help it unfortunately want sustainable in the long term because there are times when it\u2019s inconvenient to exercise (I.e. I went on a business trip where I worked really long days, the hotel didn\u2019t have a gym, and it was way too hot outside for me to run). Just 1 example, but basically I needed something that could work for me all the time so I started Zoloft",
            "Jiu jitsu. The sport itself is a very panic inducing activity. You are literally being attacked, smothered, pushed to your limits. I often have terrible anxiety walking into the gym. What I realize after a 90 min class is that I didn\u2019t have anxiety while I was rolling because I was preoccupied. I didn\u2019t die, I don\u2019t have some horrible Illness preventing me from being active. I ended up coming out the other side a more confident person knowing I can survive actual threats, not imaginary fears.",
            "Yes. It is crucial for me to do vigorous exercise regularly to keep anxiety at bay, otherwise I can feel it creep on very fast. That and avoiding refined sugar, refined carbs and high doses of caffeine (I avoid coffee and limit tea) is what works the best for me, as I manage my anxiety wothout medication. I used to not be able to but now that I sleep well (which is also crucial for managing anxiety!) I can handle it with lifestyle.",
            "weight lifting saved my confidence and life",
            "It helped me A LOT. I\u2019ve been lifting weights 4 times a week. My anxiety is almost gone. 100% recommended.",
            "Yes I\u2019ve found it\u2019s mandatory. Although weightlifting and contact sports really trigger fight or flight in me and can make things worse in the very short term during workout and right after.",
            "Yoga with Adriene on YouTube has TONS of free, guided yoga classes that feel so heartwarming to do. She has definitely unknowingly been my rock during some of my worst spurts of depression and anxiety. 100/10 couldn\u2019t recommend her enough. Such a sweet soul.",
            "Absolutely. I hike and go on walks primarily, on mountainous hilly trails usually. Even just a walk around a flat park is enjoyable. I\u2019ve found that I\u2019m a HUGE nature person, and I always have been. Walking through the wilderness, hearing the birds, noticing the trees, and if you\u2019re lucky enough the utter silence, of the outdoors. I also walk while specifically looking for reptiles and amphibians because I love finding wild frogs, snakes, lizards, etc and it\u2019s also just a fun little game! If walking or running makes your mind drift to worse things, I suggest listening to music. I\u2019m able to hyper focus on what\u2019s around me. Truly noticing every pretty leaf, every branch, every rock. Kneeling down to the ground just to stare at some moss on a log and the tiny entire world living inside of it. Those things truly leave me at peace. Just getting out of my car at an overlook and inhaling the air is refreshing and peaceful for me. \n\nStudies show just spending time outside- let alone *doing* anything- betters your mental health dramatically. As does going on walks. You don\u2019t need to get into trail running or swimming or weight lifting or anything like that, just go touch some grass! I\u2019m still relatively out of shape and don\u2019t eat very healthily or as much as I should, but *nothing* betters my mental health like connecting with nature and feeling like one with the earth.",

            "Yes I try to exercise a few times a week at least, I feel that being too sedentary, if not causes, at the very least makes my anxiety worse",
            "Yes. It helped me so much. Running kept me sane and made me so happy. Then I got long covid and I can\u2019t even go on walks anymore. Fml.",

            "The only thing that consistently keeps my mental health out of the toilet are running and yoga (doesn't have to be both, I'm just running lately when not injured). My husband noticed it first and started asking me if I was running/doing yoga that day because, so I knew my attitude was getting worse without realizing it and started paying more attention to how I felt every day. I've had a rough few months and not run very much, and not surprisingly I'm either massively anxious or barely getting out of bed depressed when I haven't been able to go running. The rest of the day on days I run, I'm actually mostly calm and I don't feel like I'm at the bottom of a bottomless pit.",

            "Lifting weights is the best",
            "I\u2019ve suffered from anxiety/depression for all of my adult life and have been on medication for over 20 years. Exercise is an important tool. Even just going for a walk outside for 15 minutes a day makes a big difference in my mood. I would absolutely encourage you to try some form of exercise. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is. As long as it gets you moving, and your heart pumping, it\u2019s good in my opinion. Keep your other tools in mind, too: get plenty of rest, drink lots of water, eat nutritious food, and be mindful. Getting out of a depression can feel like a lot of work, but with time, that work becomes habit. Take care of your mind, body, and spirit. You are worth it.",
            "It's annoying but yeah it does help. Figure out what you like to do. As a girl I was always kind of prone to cardio at the gym but I just hate it. Since I started basically just lifting a year ago I'm motivated to go 3-4 times a week. I like the feeling of soreness and of seeing growth. I'm not depressive, but there's a reason gym bros talk about the gym like it cured them of all ails...just getting up and challenging your body is something not enough people do, and it can really improve your life a lot.",
            "Doing bjj.  Sometimes it\u2019s struggle to even go , but I my thoughts are always surface level and I feel pretty amazing & normal :)",
            "It's not a cure but works better than any anti depressant.  Also eating healthy and sleeping of course.  Going on walks helps a little.  But intense exercise at least 4 days a week helps a lot.",

            "Yes\n\nI work out so hard I can't think\n\nIncluding but not limited to flipping tires and sled pulls/pushes. Sometimes it's to the point that I often get headaches after working out too hard\n\nStill better than thinking",
            "Heavy deadlifts and squats have done wonders for my mental health",

            "Exercise plus GOOD sleep hygiene ie no screens 20-40mins before bedtime oh wait....",
            "Yes. It helps, but I can't do it enough to combat it all the time. I like music and showering and sometimes chocolate and sometimes sex helps and sometimes journaling. \n\nMake a list of things that bring you joy and invest in them. Exercise or get outside when you can.",
            "I'm somewhat active but only took up running a couple weeks ago. The other day I had such a good run after a few days rest and the mental high I felt was unlike anything I've experienced in a long time, which couldn't have come at a better time because things are pretty tough at the moment. So yeah starting some exercise is definitely worth a shot.",
            "I took up martial arts and the only thing I beat up more then my enemies is my anxiety.",
            "Hell yeah! Iv been doing PPL and cardio 5 days a week and the past 4 weeks iv been my best self.",
            "I think the trick with exercise is to do something you enjoy, like for me that\u2019s a countryside walk, roller skating, or swimming. If you force yourself to go to the gym just because you feel you should, it might end up making you feel worse",

It\u2019s generally good for anyone! \n\nI started with 5 minutes of yoga and now do up to 45 minutes of exercise. Not to lose weight or tone, but it helped lift a LOT of my symptoms. \n\nThe best part is that you can choose which exercise you have the most fun with! If I had a pool, I would pick swimming. I have lots of fun with Pilates too.",
            "It's scientifically proven that it helps. I recommend finding something you like doing and starting small. I like dancing and walking in nature. it does help! Yoga also helps but it's pretty intense and can trigger my anxiety",
            "Yes I feel like exercise saved me",
            "For me, exercise was daunting at times. So my current approach is either \"the 7 minute workout\" (look it up on YouTube) or doing the treadmill at an incline of 12 and speed of 3 for 30 minutes. I then follow this with some stretching or wim hof breathing. It makes a difference!",
            "That's depression , that's not anxiety if being sad is what you are asking about rn. So yea exercise helps, like doing physical activity has a direct effect on your mental health. You can run, do any sort of exercise , do something that pushes you exhausts you , brings sweating, you will feel good after doing it. And if you get persistent with this physical exercises, bingo! Life would feel so much better with the pain in your legs, laying on your bed after a cold shower, feeling good about yourself.",

            "Moderate exercise like brisk walking that elevates your heart rate to only 120-140pm is still exercise you just need to do more of it. Combine that with a little weight lifting and you\u2019re golden without ever having to have a racing heart",

            "Dude I want to learn it so bad but I cant due to leg injury :(",
            "It also really helps train your mind to realize that staying calm is incredibly beneficial.  Panic is always followed by inadvertent exposure, and you lose (but shake hands and move on - no death).  I used to do BJJ.  Health issues incompatible at the moment, but such a good sport for mental and physical health.",
            "Thanks man. Yeah I always feel better too, after having done it. I never want to do it, but it always makes me feel better. I have racquetball club tonight, so I know I\u2019ll get a sweat going on in there. It\u2019ll be great.",
            "None of these are expensive. Sure there are up front costs but they are minimal. However, don\u2019t skimp out. Whatever you decide buy into a quality brand or you\u2019re likely to be disappointed. Not the elite stuff but not the cheapest either.",

I\u2019ve had GAD my entire life but it\u2019s the worst it\u2019s ever been this year to where I developed heart palpitations/PVCs. I saw a cardiologist and everything. I\u2019m 34, female, don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t drink, not overweight but definitely out of shape, don\u2019t even have a sip of caffeine anymore since my first PVC in May and yet I still think it\u2019s going to stop any second. I fear it happening every day to the point that even just walking around my house makes my hr spike to 130. When I get my palpitations my hr will go to 170.",
            "That\u2019s what scares me, if my hr gets over 120, I full blown panic, I kid you not. I\u2019m convinced once it\u2019s that high, my heart will get up to 200 ( it never has ) and I\u2019ll pass out and die. I used to weight lift with my husband and was able to deadlift 90lbs ( I\u2019m 5\u20191\u201d ) but now I couldn\u2019t even imagine walking down to the end of my driveway. I plan to start trying again soon though, it\u2019s just way too hot outside still where I live.",
            "I didn\u2019t either until I saw people talking about it in this sub a while back. It\u2019s awful! I get acid reflux from anxiety too which also causes a fluttering feeling so I never win. I am okay though, same to you, friend! We will survive somehow!",

Hope the best for you",

I don\u2019t smoke, quit drinking about a month ago, and I am about 20+ pounds overweight. I have GAD and have recently started taking escitalopram and trying guided meditation per my therapist and lightly exercising. The situation sucks but it feels good to not be the only one",
            "Have you ever taken a beta blocker? They are typically pretty good at keeping your hr at an even keel.\n\nI totally understand how you feel though. It\u2019s been a slow process but I would get heart palpitations getting up from my bed or something and was terrified of it. \n\nStarted running a few months ago. Resting heart rate is down to 53-55. Your brain will start to get used to those sensations and won\u2019t freak out as bad. Your heart is a VERY strong muscle and is meant to beat! Did 6 miles this morning. \n\nMy thought process is that if I can train, become an endurance runner and be able to build up that cardiovascular fitness, I\u2019d know my heart is strong and healthy. If I can run a marathon, I know my heart can handle a little panic attack!",
            "As someone who suffered from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and went through three heart surgeries, I try to not let fear drive my decision, but exercise and still take precautions. For example, I'm always using a heart rate monitor when I exercise. And I stop if I think my heart feels funny.\n\nAt the worst point in between surgeries, I thought I was cured and once tried going running. After about 2km, I had to stop. My HR was 250+. So the fear can be very real\n\nI've suffered from childhood emotional trauma and suffered from a great deal of work stress as well. They all add up and I think they are the chief contributors to my condition. Well, the condition is gone (for now) post surgery, and I'm trying to find a healthy way of living that includes working when I can, but also knowing I can never push myself too much.\n\nI would also like to say that my surgeries gave me PTSD about my health, so I feel for OP. But on the other had, fear of your health is a stress you're putting on yourself that can actually make things worse. I know it's easier said than done, but try to avoid thinking about it. Instead, exercise within reason and try to listen to your body without being paranoid.",

            "I have been prescribed propranolol but I was scared to take it because I usually have low blood pressure. At the doctor when I\u2019m in full blown panic mode it\u2019s like 122/87, that's my \"high\". Usually it's more like 80-90/60. My psychiatrist warned that it could lower BP and so I got scared it would get EVEN lower. I take hydroxyzine as needed but it knocks me out and I\u2019ve been trying to get back on Zoloft for 3.5 months to lower the baseline anxiety but my psychiatrist thinks it isn\u2019t working and wants me to think about switching. \n\nI definitely want to get back to walking when the weather cools off and take it slow. I've never liked exercise like at the gym but I'd love to be a runner! Thank you for your comment!",
            "This is helpful advice, thank you. I have had all the testing done and it\u2019s all been totally fine according to the cardiologist, so when I read stories and experiences like yours I just feel silly for being so worried. If I had surgery and a real diagnosis I\u2019d have a reason to be scared! I am working on overcoming the fear though because I know movement is good for me and will only benefit in the long run.

I always get anxious to try new meds, but get to a point where I think \u201ccan\u2019t be any worse than I am now,\u201d and I just send it. I took metoprolol and generally just felt a bit more confident with my elevated heart rate. \n\nI just got off Zoloft because it wasn\u2019t seeming to help me either. Trying trintellix now and a super low dose of clonazepam. \n\nI did get super anxious to run in the beginning and still do! When id start to panic I\u2019d beat my chest like \u201ccome on mother******, you\u2019ve got this.\u201d I\u2019d also run with a cold neck gaiter and that helped me too. Worst case scenario, I\u2019d tan my head under the water fountain and shock my system with the cold. Usually calmed me down pretty well. \n\nIdk where you are, but I\u2019m in Texas so the heat was BRUTAL this summer. Stopped running outside during the day because it was unbearably hot. 112 degrees and what not. Very interested to see how my running pans out with cooler weather. Should be easier and heart shouldn\u2019t beat as fast! Also always felt like the more my heart was beating from workouts, the more relaxed I\u2019d be the rest of that day. Like you get it out of your system or something?! Good luck on your journey, you def aren\u2019t alone!\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Thank you! Yeah I am being coaxed to try Effexor instead but I am going to think on it a couple weeks and see how it goes. I failed Lexapro, Buspar, and now Zoloft :/ \n\nI\u2019m also in Texas! And heat exacerbates my anxiety even more to the point where I\u2019m convinced I have heat stroke. It sucks! I\u2019m trying so hard to get to the acceptance point of all this fear, but it has been super hard. Appreciate the encouragement, I hope I find some bravery soon! \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Lexapro helped me for a little over a year! Tried Wellbutrin, buspar, lex, metoprolol, and Zoloft. Trintellix is supposed to be one of the ones to try if you haven\u2019t done well on normal ssris. We will see, but we gotta keep fighting!\n\nI won\u2019t give up if you don\u2019t! Let\u2019s help each other! \n\nThe heat definitely can exacerbate that anxiety and we sure do have plenty of it here. Should start cooling off in October!\n\nI used to play college baseball and spent basically 22 summers of my life playing in the heat. Now I\u2019m like, how the hell did I do that?\ud83e\udd23\n\nYou will find some bravery soon enough! Lmk if you have any questions on getting back to working out. After college I stopped because I was tired of it all. Slowly getting back to it. Keep your head up!",
            "Same! I took Lexapro for 2 years actually and stupidly got off of it in November of 2022 and by January I was a wreck. And then stayed stubborn until the PVC situation in May when I was finally like, well hell, guess I need meds again, because I legit thought I\u2019d need to be admitted to the psych ward I felt so out of it. And I\u2019ve taken Zoloft off and on for years but it\u2019s not working this time for some reason! I have heard of Trintellix and I\u2019m curious if it works. My recommendation was Effexor because my psychiatrist wants me to try an SNRI over another SSRI. Which I get but now I feel like 3.5 months on Zoloft has been wasted, it was not a fun onboarding experience. But no, I won\u2019t give up! I will take any and all support!\n\nIt\u2019s because when we were younger life just didn\u2019t work the same \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 that and I swear the heat here this year is worse than it\u2019s ever been, I don\u2019t think it was literal hell temps without a break 10+ years ago. \n\nI definitely will! I appreciate you, I love talking to people that just \u201cget it\u201d, much as I love my friends and family. Nobody that I know has anxiety as bad as I do.",
            "The trial and error absolutely sucks and very discouraging. After trying Wellbutrin and it not working it took me another 6 months to try something else. After lex I wasn\u2019t taking anything for another 6 months and felt like shit again. Tried the Buspar and didn\u2019t feel anything, not even side effects. Felt like I was taking a sugar pill. 100mg of zoloft helped a bit so I was hopeful an increased dose would help more. 150mg killed me and got into a super deep depression and panicky state. Couldn\u2019t sleep and was constantly anxious. Also nausea was insane for me on zoloft. \n\nUnfortunately, this last summer is probably the coolest summer we will have here for the rest of our life \ud83e\udd74\n\nAbsolutely, I LOVE chatting it up with people that know exactly how you feel. It\u2019s so easy to feel alone and alienated in your circle. Nobody I know has it as bad as me so it\u2019s hard for them to understand. Even my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t get it, so it\u2019s really tough.",

It always comes in waves. Over the years I've ignored it, given into it, tried to distract myself from it, talked to friends about it, had a few breakdowns, made myself ill, given myself an eating disorder trying to distract from it and now I'm trying to do things new way.   \nLately, my situation is fucked and my anxiety is some of the worst it's ever been. But I've got some people to help me (i.e. my therapist and psychiatric nurse) which makes me feel that I'm in a better position to be ok.

Moreso anxiety than depression but I do cry a lot when I feel this way so maybe both after all\n\nHoping that it's just a momentary dalliance and that I'll get back to \"normal\" soon.

Went to my GP shortly after and I learned I was completely fine, blood sugar levels and blood pressure was perfect, and it was as if the symptoms I'd suffered vanished without a trace by the time I got into my car outside the doctors office.\n\nMoved across the country in 2022 to study and have become socially isolated, and I lost access to the woods (that I love), so the GAD came back. Had a really rough patch during spring last year, and it's come back this january with the worst feeling of \"you are in fact dying RIGHT NOW\" I've ever experienced while I was trying to sleep one night. Been dealing with it since then. Finally got in touch my doctor again just yesterday out of desperation, asking for any pills at all that could help.\n\nAnxiety is such a weird thing. I am completely aware of what's happening, why it's happening, that I have nothing to be afraid of, that I'm absolutely not dying of anything, yet here I am, with a tightness in my chest, dizzy spells, and the feeling of death washing over me.

I started medication about 3 years ago and that was the game changer for me. It was a last resort because I was so afraid to try it, tried everything else I could before that. I tried to wean off the medication at one point and had a severe relapse. So now, I\u2019m on medication and still in therapy. It\u2019s the best combination for me.

My doctor refused the referral and referred me to an internal KP psychologist instead who just medicated me on SSRI without providing any other therapy or coping techniques.

I\u2019ve been tapering off of it for the last month now and shed almost all the weight I gained and feel more alive now then when I was on SSRI. \n\nMy recommendation is to try and find a good reputable therapist who specializes in CBT in combination with SSRI if needed.

That being said, it can take a while before you find the right therapist and medication, and for someone who is already under a lot of stress, this is very offputting. Not to mention therapy sessions can cost $200 a session quite often for people who are uninsured. And it can take weeks even to get an appointment with said doctor, cause no surprise!, they're always booked. It is not even easy to seek help, and when you're already feeling defeated or depressed, it makes things much more difficult. It can be even more depressing if you don't have the finances or resources. And if you don't have a family or friend support system, it makes treatment almost impossible, because who's gonna be there for you while you're waiting for the meds to start working or searching for the right therapist? The system is fucked up in my opinion, honestly. Everyone wants to preach about getting help and going to therapy but they don't realize the hassle and logistics it can take. \"Seeking help\" is not instantaneous and not immediately the answer. It's not always about avoiding the problem- some of us don't have the means to even start to get help. In a society where mostly everything is available, mental health treatment still makes you jump through hoops. Maybe healthcare in general.",

(As in, let's just throw different medications at the person until one sticks. They've been doing it the same way basically since antidepressants first came on the market)\n\nMost people who are on them had to try several before arriving at a combination that works. There is no test to find out what neurotransmitters you're deficient in, there's literally no concrete way to find out how a medication will effect you before you start taking it. You need to start it, stay on it for at least 6-8 weeks for your medical professional to be convinced you gave it a fair try, and if you have the numerous intolerable side effects (including much worse symptoms that could land someone in the hospital for a suicide attempt)? Well that just sucks for you, because if you try to come off it before that 6-8 weeks is up then your doctor won't listen and will say you need to keep trying it.\n\nThen there's the fact the more physical side effects can create other health problems in life that can add to your mental health problems (many antidepressants cause insomnia! Ffs, it's hard enough to sleep as an anxious person without a chemical reason keeping me awake too) so you're trading out one thing making your life miserable for another thing. Sure there are many people who are lucky enough that they get only the benefits with minimal side effects, but anxious people don't tend to just accept \"guess I'll just try this and find out!\" As an approach to life in general. Seriously there are antidepressants that make you agitated and fill you with restless energy so you trade being depressed for being anxious, and anti-anxiety meds that are so sedating that you sleep in bed all day and have no energy, effectively trading anxiety for depression \n\nThere's also often a huge lack of empathy or concern for people who are worried over side effects or the medications making things worse. You're often ignored or brushed off, asked if you would rather be depressed/anxious or fat, sleepless, agitated, sluggish, completely emotionally flat...as if those things are just so very easy to live with. \n\nI completely understand why many people don't even want to entertain the idea of medications. It's not a magic cure-all that comes with no stipulations or considerations. There are many people for whom the side effects simply aren't worth it. There are other routes that are much more effective and less harmful (namely therapy) but therapy is hard and messy and it's much easier to just throw pills at people and then tell them to deal",

            "This is my story. Developed panic disorder, started pills without even thinking. Quit them when they explained that they are \"harmful\" but that I don't even need them becouse they don't cure anything or that specific disorder. I quit them, they come back, researched alot and won the battle 3 years now no panic attacks or afraid of them. I had some anxiety but I refused to be on pills becouse I know that everything really is in my head. I beat agoraphobia, fears and improved alot without pills. I'm afraid of what pills can do to my brain and the side effects. I'm not scared of being stuck on them becouse when I took them for 3 mouths I hated them and wanted to stop them, when I quit them I had 0 withdrawal symptoms. I really did not feel a different, maybe somewhat boost of anxiety after a year? Still the pill left my body long, long ago. Had alot of stress and anxiety it got to me too much had to skip work alot becouse a bad case of \"anxiety poo\" so I'm on pills again on day 7. I have not been this happy and proud of myself before developing anxiety. I'm only going to use them until I solve my stomach problem, I will enjoy my happiness and feeling normal, I deserve it for fighting for 3 years all alone. I don't want to be on pills all my life I'm quiting them after 6 mouths or max a year as per recommend. In the meantime I'm studying what the key of happiness is, solving my stomach problems I delayed for ages that made my anxiety spiked to the sky, learn to enjoy life for what it is, prove to myself that I don't need a god da*m pill to function and live a happy life, show anxiety that I'm on top of the food chain, prove to myself that I'm stronger than ever before and that nothing can crush me, build a strong immunity to stress, respect my body and it's needs alot more, make habbits that boost happiness and positivity to escape the hell the brain makes me feel from automatic thoughts. I really dislike pills but maybe that was the only option I had to not lose my job and get it over with my stomach problem and focus learning how I can be happy again becouse I HAVE EVERYTHING A MAN COULD WISH FOR but even then I still feel unhappy. Happiness is a skill that I need to re-learn to myself. Remove bad habits of my brains automatic thoughts and crush it once and for all. For my day 7 the side effects are insanely high sex drive (my girl hardly walks now lol) and a huge boost to happiness. I don't even know if it's from the pill becouse pill starts working after two weeks but I feel happier than ever before starting on day five. I really did not have an option Im a delivery driver and with anxiety poo you can just think about it how bad it was to go to work for me I was crying for 8 mouths everyday I had to work and be stuck in traffic with diarrhea constantly. I had to choose to lose my job or take the pill. I can't lose my job becouse I have a family that holds on my shoulders! I'm still kinda sad for starting them but this too shall pass. I love my job becouse it's social face to face, I can't be stuck on a monitor all day at home or office. \nThis is my story, why I don't like pills but had to take resently but I don't plan to stay on them for long, only until I get my feet on the ground and show anxiety that it has no match on me.",

So denial is sometimes easier. And coming to terms with having to take mental health medicine every day to control your brain chemicals and just to feel ok, can also make someone feel weak.

I am honestly in a better place mentally than I was years ago. I find things to keep me busy and have limited contact with family members (the ones who had initially caused things).  I cut a lot of people and things out of my life that were making everything worse and recently changed my entire work schedule to something that better suits my needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a handful of wonderful, wonderful friends and an extremely patient boyfriend that give me comfort and space when needed.

I have animals as well, and they amazing at reminding me that they love me (especially when I'm having a really bad episode).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like a lot of us probably have experienced a lot of the same issues and find our own ways to cope.",

I used to take SSRI's and I found they made my depression worse almost every time and the other ones didn't do anything at all. For anxiety Lorazapam worked well but you're not supposed to take that one long term.\n\nFor others it's internalized ableism. I know some people don't like the idea of taking medication forever, but a lot of those people will take supplements everyday, or vitamins. There are some people who wont accept medical intervention of any kind, they wouldn't take blood pressure meds or anything. But there are some with specific internalized ableism around mental illness.  \n\nFor others the cost is just too much. They can't afford it and it's a long term investment. My doctors have told me it takes 3-6 months just to see if there's improvement. then if it does work, thats a monthly reoccurring bill. \n\nSome people don't take medication for religious reasons, although in my experience this is mostly Jehovahs Witness's or super fundamentalist Christians (it's in Gods hands and whatnot)\n\nI saw other's mention phobia's which is a totally valid reason as well. \n\nProbably lots more reasons I haven't thought of but those are the ones that came to mind initially",

            "Oh god, I remember getting prescribed medicine for anxiety + anti depressants and everyone around me was like there\u2019s no need to take it etc. I literally just said yeah of course I won\u2019t.",
            "Oh wow\u2026",
            "Yup, I won't even take Tylenol unless I absolutely have to. \n\nAs a Mexican, our culture also has a bad habit of denying mental health issues.",
            "Yeah, I was given setraline and diazepam but wouldn't take it. I can't have my senses numbed as I have a 4 year old with asd and a 1 year old. I also can't take the chance that the medication itself has a further negative effect on my mental health.",
            "Yeah\u2026 I think people get scared from all the horror stories about meds.. I remember when I was at my worst, I said to myself, \u201cI would eat rat poop\u201d if I could make this crazy anxiety and depression let up! I was so sick, medication was all I could think about",
            "That's me. Plus my anxiety is manageable",

I have my sanity back. I know a lot of people in the recovery community who refuse meds because \"it's replacing one substance with another.\" I'm like... sure, except this substance doesn't cause you to lose everything good in your life and terrorize your loved ones?

I am on a few depression subs and there's constant posts about people not wanting to tell their doctor because they don't want to be institutionalized in a mental health ward.\n\nHaving been in a ward for a few weeks once I can completely understand that sentiment. It was by far the worst experience of my life and is not conducive to good mental health.",
            "The first people I went to when I was having the worst anxiety of my life was to a general practitioner.. They thought I had the flu! I was in such bad shape I couldn\u2019t even hardly talk\u2026 They finally sent me away to a psychiatrist cuz I was so bad",

The very VERY first time I felt strange in my head for 4 weeks I went to a clinic, they told me I had a sinus infection \ud83d\udc80 I then had my first big panic attack 2 months later that completely altered my life. I ended up going to the doctor bc I thought I was dying, he gave me quick fix anxiety meds\u2026 no one took me serious until I went to a psychiatrist, I wish I would have gone from the start. I was contemplating a neurologist in the past too until I finally discovered what I was going through lol",
            "Definitely this. I got referred to an ENT consultant a few years ago because of a lump in my throat that my GP thought could be a tumour. Got fast tracked and seen within a few days. He was really nice and reassuring\u2026 until he asked if I was on any medication and I said I was on Propranalol for anxiety. Immediately he asked if I had been anxious about my throat and that\u2019s why I had been fast tracked. I said that no, I hadn\u2019t been worried about it, it was my GP who was concerned (this is true - I had gone in with a sinus infection She made me come back 2 weeks later to check my throat again, and when the swelling hadn\u2019t gone away she did the referral. I wasn\u2019t worried about it at all until I got the call the next day regarding an appointment and realised she had asked for me to be fast tracked). He checked my throat, said there was nothing wrong, the commented that \u201cThis is what happens - people with nothing wrong with them get fast tracked and then people with real problems don\u2019t get seen until it\u2019s too late.\u201d So now I\u2019m always scared of being judged as wasting people\u2019s time / taking up time that someone else needs more if I ask for help.",

They are very booked and extremely expensive. I\u2019m a dad with 7 kiddos so my finances are stretched!! I do have a good psychiatrist, she\u2019s not too crazy expensive, but very caring and extremely helpful. You definitely need friends and loved ones to help you, and NOT make fun of you or say away things that make your sickness 100 times worse\u2026 I get it",
            "It took me like 4 months to find a therapist/med management after my double transplant.  It\u2019s crazy.  Even the ones I eventually found my med management prescriber isn\u2019t in NY.  I must have one of the only out of state ones.  So I can\u2019t even get scripts filled lol",

There is no stigma around mental health. Probably because we all suffer from it! Lol. We are not JW\u2019s or fundamentalist.. but I definitely know what your referring to.. crazy.",
            "Upvoted! You definitely nailed it on this one. Especially when you said \u201c I thought it made me morally better\u201d to not be on medication.. I hear that all the time.. but when your the one who is miserably sick with horrible anxiety and awful depression, you forget about being tough, and reach out for help! At least I did..",
            "This is one of the best responses so far in my opinion. I agree. \u201cThe Cult of Fitness Cured Everything\u201d is wrong. I\u2019m in very good shape, been working out for most of my adult life.\n\nI believe it\u2019s one intervention, but adding medication along side of it has its great benefits too.

            "Seeing as I was in the Dr's from October to January, at least once per month or more and saw 5 different people ... whom all either misdiagnosed me or just said *I dunno* and showed **zero** interest in helping me work through the puzzle I was experiencing ... this is a major reason for me",
            "I am very scared of medication. One of my biggest fears is being medicated against my will.",
            "If it's not too personal, can you share your experience with meds and how you started on that route and how's it working out for you?\n\nI see very few stories about this, probably exactly because of that fear of addiction/side effects.",
            "Hah, I was a horrible alcoholic and anxiety made it so much worse. I was drinking over a fifth a day.\n\nI managed to quit with the help of cannabis, and I got the same criticism.\n\nLike, one of the two is destroying my liver and also destroying the lives of people close to me, and the other makes me sleepy and a little stupid. These things are not the same.",

            "I think that when you have crippling anxiety that the prospect of not being in control even more of your brain -when you already feel so out of control is what would stop a lot of people from getting the correct medication. They are probably scared of what it would do to them. Scared of it sedating them possibly. Being a shell of themselves. A couch potatoe, Or Possibly scared of it amplifying all of the negative affects that they have to deal with already. Making them crazy and hyper. I have a friend that went through a similar situation and they had to go to therapy and it took a long time for the therapist to convince them to give it a go because they were just terrified of not being themselves if that makes sense. They already felt like they had such a little control over everything by taking medication it was just one more thing that they wouldn\u2019t be able to control once they take it.",

            "Ultimately what I'm trying to say is that there are people like me where it didn't work for sure- and there are people who would greatly benefit from the help and meds. \n\nIt comes down to the person and their environment. Mental Health is heavy and complicated. I have major depressive, major anxiety, and ptsd. Meds can't help me sadly. Multiple different meds and counselors/psych/therapists couldn't help me- so I had to help myself. It is very tough because I wish it in fact HELPED me. Others do gain from the help- and to that I say that's amazing! Thank you for this thread- it opened a discussion to show that getting help isn't as black or white or as easy as it sounds. It is complex.",

As for going out more and becoming the social butterfly I used to be- I don't think that's possible anymore with how fake others have been to me/ how messed up others have been. I'm going to keep to myself and only love those who love me...",
            "Yeah and even intrusive thoughts from ocd drastically reduced after 10 months and non specific eating disorder remission immediately with t2 diabetes and bipolar.  All started when I got t2 diabetes and was told to change diet.  I've eaten a healthy diet most of my life but it was the low carb, no sugar, no artificial sweetener, only saturated fat and cold pressed fruit oils (avocado/olive)...basically a diet of fat, meat, non starchy veg and berries that has made me feel so good.  Some stuff went into remission immediately some took longer.  Anxiety took much longer I've noticed the gad reducing more and more.  \n\nI sleep on a schedule (bed at 10 every night asleep by midnight latest and up by 8-830), exercise minimum 1 hour walking 5 days a week which brings me to about 10k steps total (I had become completely sedentary), low carb whole food diet and trying to socialize more.  I have a weekly dinner with family.  Making a routine and commitments helped but I was very active and fit when I was at my most unwell.  I was only obese on the meds so I had to find another way.  Its trial and error.  Biggest thing i noticed?  Dietary changes.  At the start i needed saturated fat and if i tried to reduce it once the depression went away it would start to return.  After a year I can eat less without negative impact to my mental health but it's still my primary source it was like I was starved for it.  I grew up on a lean protein/low fat(all veg oil)/complex carb diet and just seemed to feel worse and worse.\n\nNutritionalnpsychiatry and keto4mentalhealth are both active subs.  I was surprised to find out other people were finding benefits as well because I really expected to never have any change except with drugs.  The anxiety I do have is difficult to manage but it is easier for me to slow down, do yoga, breathing exercises.  I do art and started going to church (raised athiest just started going) and meditating as they all give the same feelings of relief.  What works for me might not work for everyone but it certainly has felt like a frigging miracle and I actively seek out anxiety reduction in my daily life.  I still cannot handle any stress but I can live in the world again.",

There are many people out there who have done it as well.\n\nAs it is with all diseases, the faster you get diagnosed and receive treatment, the better the chances of recovery. One never knows what part of the brain these diseases will attack next.

            "Yes, sure. Thank you for asking. In 2019 I had a nervous breakdown. I was driving to work when this terrible feeling came over me. I thought I was having a heart attack. Came home early, felt this sickening feeling of dread, terror, and impending doom come over in such strong waves I thought I was dying\u2026 scary thing is, I didn\u2019t know what it was, or what was happening to me\u2026 which intensified everything. I quickly got worse, to the point I couldn\u2019t get out of bed.\nI just laid there with something that could be closely related to akithesia. I couldn\u2019t stop moving and shaking. And the terror on top of it made me petrified\u2026 I still wasn\u2019t on any meds yet cuz I still didn\u2019t know what was happening.\nI then went to a holistic doctor, who was very expensive and did absolutely nothing but aggravate my symptoms and made them worse.\n\nHe finally gave up. Couldn\u2019t figure it out. One day it had gotten so bad I literally called my primary doctor and managed to get to the doctor. I trembled and rocked back and forth in the waiting room. It was like I was having a continual panic attack 24/7\u2026 no sleep on top of it! Everything looked like it was happening in a horror movie. I went inside the doctor\u2019s office and they looked at me and said they couldn\u2019t help because I was so sick, that I needed a mental health specialist. I managed to get myself to a psychiatrist and they treated me with lexapro and Xanax. I did not take the Xanax, but started lexapro. It slowly pulled me out of the nasty pit of terror\u2026 but when my psychiatrist increased the dose of lexapro I had a floor encountering panic attack.. laid me out for 3 days. Switched to Trintellix. Finally and gradually got better\u2026..",

Just constantly hiding and lying. In hindsight I think after a while I was confusing constantly staving off withdrawal symptoms with anxiety.\n\nI'm glad you found success with cannabis! For me, I quit when I quit drinking. Sometimes I consider smoking again, but since I was pretty much always drunk when I've smoked in the past, I'm worried it would be triggering. It's one of those things where it would probably be fine, but the small risk of it not being fine is just not worth it to me.\n\nCongrats on kicking the booze. It's surreal to think about how much alcoholism completely rewires your mind. It takes a lot of work to unlearn.",

But these past days I have had anxiety (no attacks.. just being scared) and I am so afraid they dont work or that I need more. What symptoms did your son have when he was getting off them? Sorry if I am being rude, but I feel like there is so little information online about Lyrica. \nI also have tried different meds, where Sertraline was the worst and totally killed my sexdrive. \nAlso, so sorry your son had to go through all that and that he suffers so much with anxiety.

Something about the fact that it works just as well (if not better) than a particular prescription drug, and the drug companies were trying to claim patent rights on the substance. You know, typical of our capitalistic healthcare in the US.   \n\nI'll have to dig up my bottle of NAC and try it for my anxiety. If only I could get past the horrible smell of it.",
            "I can kinda fake it out for a while but I can\u2019t keep a \u201ctraditional\u201d job for longer than 6 weeks. I\u2019m freelancing rn and hoping to find a more permanent solution eventually",
            "It's OK for some people but our experience with it has been horrible, and from what I can see in the various Facebook and Reddit groups covering the drug, many other people find it the same. One of the worst things about it is that getting off it can cause huge anxiety... so why doctors think it's a good idea to prescribe it for anxiety is beyond me... it's proper use is for relieving nerve pain!\n\nIt may have worked at first for our son but any good effect quickly wore off... so the doctor increased the dose (this is very common), and then increased it again, and again. In the end he was on 300mg (100mg 3 times a day). After about two years of taking it he tried to get off it himself, titrating bit by bit (with each small drop costing him terrible mental anguish) till he got to 250mg. Then he tried going back to work again and got so stressed he panicked, reinstating to the full 300mg dose  (reinstating to full dose, as we have learnt, is not something anyone should ever do. Reinstating to half the size of the drop is best). This is when it got really bad. He started suffering from intrusive thoughts and depression (not a factor before). After a while we persuaded the doctor to prescribe liquid pregabalin and started blind-titrating (to remove any chance of the withdrawal pains being psychological). I measured out his dose each day and we took records of his mental state. When I felt he had stabilised enough from the previous drop I'd drop him again.\n\nAfter 5 months we got him down to 150mg per day but he could take no more drops and so decided to go to a detox centre (Bosense farm in Cornwall UK). Here they got him of it in three weeks. We were expecting him to come home a basket case but much to our amazement he handled it very well and came home in a much better state. When he has a badly anxious day now he takes NAC and it sorts him out every time. We are still a bit stunned by it. It is quite amazing to hear him singing to himself and to have normal family conversations with us where he smiles naturally and isn't just grunty, cold and stressed, as he tended to be before.\n\nI should point out that he is also on a low dose of Metazapine (30mg). This is about the only prescribed drug that seems to have helped him (and the jury is a bit out on that). At this low dose it helps him get a good night's sleep (he takes it just before bed). He hopes to get off that soon too. (He used to take a higher does but found it too much like an SSRI, which were all bad for him).\n\nLike you, he also took Sertraline. Getting used to it was horrible, it did not have any benefit whilst he was on it and then it was horrible getting off it too. I think out of all of them though, Venlafaxine (aka Efexor), an SNRI, was the worst.\n\nThe only prescribed drugs that have relieved his mental anguish are the benzodiazepenes (valium etc)... but addiction and dependency are a real problem (and yup, he got addicted to them!). However, in the early days an enlightened doctor did prescribe us low dose valium to give to him on an as-and-when basis. That worked quite well for odd days when it all got too much for him.\n\nI must reiterate that the effects of pregabalin seems to be highly individual. He has an online gaming partner (he met in an online mental health chat group) that suffers from depression who was prescribed a high dose of pregabalin (which didn't work for him). He took if for nearly a year and then got off it in two jumps... with no issues whatsoever! So, you too might not have any problem with it.\n\nMy son is now 21. His issues with anxiety started 4.5 years ago after abusing high strength marijuana, ketamine, ecstacy and benzodiazepenes. He has not taken illegal drugs for nearly two years now and looks after himself very well... goes to the gym and walks the dogs every day, studies psychology at Open University, works as a carer at a mental health home(!) two days a week, eats and sleeps well and takes a good number of supplements. He also spends 2 or 3 hours each day online gaming with buddies.\n\nHe has tried very hard and we are now cautiously optimistic he is coming out of the other side of it. It has been a slog though and, for us at least, psychiatric drugs, rather than helping, seemed to compound and extend his problems. In retrospect I do wish he'd not started on that route.\n\nBut... everyone's experience is different. Please do bear that in mind.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the Reddit pregabalin group but if you use Facebook try seaching for:\n\n1. Lyrica Survivors (Pregabalin and Gabapentin Support)   -  this is the best one. Amy, who runs it is excellent\n2. Gabapentin/Lyrica Withdrawal Support - also reasonably good\n\nI am more than happy to continue the conversation in a private chat if I can be of any help (and I've learnt so much in the last 4.5 years it's be terrible of me not to put it to use helping others if I can). Anxiety is a terrible thing.... but it is possible to get free of it.\n\nLate edit: I should have mentioned that generally, the longer one takes it for the more problem it is to get free of it.",
            "Did it help?",
            "Oh wow!! \n\nFirst of all, thank you so much for taking the time and the interest to reply my question! And is such detail! Thank you for sharing such a journey with me and all of us! \n\nSecond; I am truly happy to hear, how well your son is doing after all of this! I can\u2019t begin to imagine how it must be fighten drug abuse! I am so sorry he had to go through all of that, but I believe he must be such a strong person from all of this! It sounds like it! Congrats to him and you! \n\nI have suffered from mental health issues for years, since I was a child. And I didnt get a proper diagnoses until well into my 20\u2019s. But I never really got much medicine, since I have always been too scared of it. Then I agreed to sertraline, took it for 3 years and decided that I didnt want to take it any longer, since I knew the withdrawal was horrible, and it was!! I never want to do that again. Also just too many side effects, as you know. \n\nThen I didnt take any medication for some years, and my anxiety started really flaring up again, really bad. And I didnt want to take medication, for a while I denied it, because of fear. And in the end I caved, because the anxiety is just too bad and I am scared of losing my mind and my partner and all I have builed up. So I agreed to taking meds, and my doctor chose pregabalin, since it wasnt an antidepressent, and she said it has worked really well for many. I was a bit sceptic, since the drugs said it was used for nervepain and epilepsia. But I listened to my doctor, but I only agreed to the smallest dose. Which ofc didnt do anything. So after 2 month I got up tp 50 mg, which again is not a whole lot, at all. And then agreeing to 100 mg, then 150 mg and finally 200 mg- which I know, is still not a whole lot for anxiety. But I am so scared of this drug. \n\nI honestly am so Happy I asked, and found this. I will talk to my doctor about my worries and what I find other peoples experience to be. And maybe she will agree on some other drug. I just need to be able to function again. \n\nSo thank you once again, for your story and your advise! I really appreciate it! \nI wish you and your son a happy life!!",
            "[removed]",
            "One last thing. If you decide pregabalin is not for you and titrate off it...... if the reductions become too much don't reinstate to your full dose. Reistate to half the amount you have reduced by. This is important. Pregabalin can turn on people when they reinstate to full dose. And don't let your doctor take you off it too fast.\n\nSaying that, you are still on a low dose and it looks like have not been taking it for very long(?) so maybe you'll not have any issues getting off it, if that is what you should decide to do.\n\nI think most doctors need an education about pregabalin. They tend to get fed too much info by drug companies and feedback from patients is not shared (in the UK at least). In the UK it has just been classed as a 'controlled drug' (like benzodiazepenes have been for a long time) which is a step in the right direction. I am happy for you to show my post above to you doctor if you should want to.",

You just need to find a comfortable space (physically) and do your best to remain calm and branch out your comfort zones. \n\nIt's not fun, but it gets better, I promise. Even if the residual anxiety never goes away, you become more efficient at managing it. Eventually it becomes a matter of \"taking your mind off\" of the feelings.\n\nBest of luck mate.",

            "A place to start is this: Do the opposite of what you feel like you want to be doing. \n\nDepression makes your body slow down, so speed it up. Get out of bed, go out, be active, exercise, take a walk, be a bit more social, etc. The more you lay around sedentary the easier it is to continue doing the same. You need to break the cycle. \n\nAnxiety makes your mind speed up, so slow it down (this is a bit harder, admittedly than speeding your body up, but can be done). Force yourself to take slow, deep breaths from your diaphragm, be mindful of your breath as you do it counting, or noticing the cool and warm air entering and leaving. You can be mindful doing lots of things, actually. Your brain will naturally derail here and there, and fixate on something or another. When it does, you take notice, (nonjudgmentally!) and simply return to being mindful of breathing. \n\nThis was too much for me at first, so other things to slow your mind can sometimes help too: listening to music, taking a scenic relaxing drive, taking a bath, doing an activity that distracts you, being creative/artistic. Add anything else that slows those thoughts! There are tons of things, and some work differently for different people. \n\nHope this helps!",

But once I sucked it up and began a routine I felt really proud of myself.\n\nIt's hard, but you'll be glad. Your therapist is right on target. Exercise has been shown to show progress for depression and anxiety patients at least 3/4 of the time. Plus, exercise gives you more energy, which will make you more motivated (in case you're worried about motivation continuing to lack).\n\nGood luck!",

            "Maybe you've tried this already as you mention you listen to relaxing things to fall asleep, but I have diagnosed anxiety, and for me the best way to get to sleep reliably is to listen to (not watch) a sitcom on my phone. Every night I put a show on on a streaming app, turn my phone upside down so that it's not emitting light, and listen to the show until I drift off. It's kind of like a bedtime story in a way. The main thing is that as long as I'm listening to the events of the show and following the story, my mind isn't racing. I use sitcoms specifically because they have a new fun, wacky plotline every episode and are lighthearted, not dark or serious or thought-provoking in a way that could trigger my anxiety. On occasion, I have also used game shows like Family Feud, but I imagine that would only work for you if you are the type of person to get invested in and actively play along with game shows, like I am.",

But there are also more specific methods to address more specific root causes. For example, my brain gets overactive at night when I am trying to fall asleep, keeping me awake. Watching or listening to things works sometimes, but often keeps me awake. Instead, I fall asleep trying to think of stories and settings for a worldbuilding project. It keeps my brain busy on something light, fun, and easy to fall asleep to. When that doesnt work, I try some mindfulness exercises to focus on physical feelings and clear my mind. Gotta find what works for you, and maybe it's none, some, or all of those general things, or maybe you just need the right solution for your problem. \n\nGood luck!

Had to wake up early and go to church with family and wear a DRESS. Then dread going to school the next day. Also having to live with someone else that worked during the week and they always wanted to do the grocery shopping and other annoying stuff that made me just dread it even more on a Sunday. \n\nSchedule something really fun or satisfying that is only reserved for Sundays. Make it something you can really look forward to. That's the only way I can imagine to deal with it. Don't do chores like grocery shopping or food prep because that can make it worse.",

There's nothing I can do to stop Monday from coming, so I focus on what I can do to make my Sunday as relaxing and enjoyable as possible. Be present. Make your Sunday *sacred*. Relax and enjoy it for what it is, even when it's not ideal.\n\nBut this also makes me super protective of my weekend downtime and that can make me defensive and cause panic attacks as well, so I have to work hard to be objective about it. Weekends don't always work out like I want even when I have a trying week ahead. Also, take Mondays off when you can. Tuesday is never as bad as Monday.",
            "This was debilitating most of my life until recently. It always caused me to stay up late fighting my sleep. I would always oversleep Monday morning and people just assumed I was lazy. That just pissed me off worse and made me more self conscious.  \n\nI\u2019ve gotten several hobbies to deal with it and look forward to on the weekend. \n\nAlso, my work from home job has really helped. I don\u2019t have the anxiety of driving around assholes or dreading seeing people first thing Monday morning.",

            "Some of it is on Sunday evenings for me, but the worst hits me on Monday mornings, right when I wake up, go to work and am at work. \n\nI used to double up on anxiety meds on Sunday nights to counteract that but that's not an option for me anymore. \n\nThe only two things I can possibly do to help is using CDB products and/or exercising. Even if the only exercise is doing pushups until I can't anymore. \n\nI try to find myself something to look forward to on Monday afternoons after work. Even if it's something as simple as buying a candy bar. \n\nNothing completely cures my Monday morning anxiety for the work week, so if anyone has any ideas that'll help, I'm all ears.",

I lie in bed and wake up and almost immediately have an overwhelming sense of dread and despair to the point that I puke before going in to work.

I become hyper aware of my senses and a hypochondriac about every pain, headache, dizziness I experience. The only think I can do is check myself.  I try to stop my swirling thoughts and remember that this happens to me ALL the time.  I'm not dying, having a stroke, having a heartattack, or brain tumor or whatever.  I'm just fucking anxious about going to work.",
            "Yeah",
            "Yes. One thing I always do Sundays is I open up my work laptop so I can see my schedule the next day and see when I have meetings and things like that. \n\nJust the idea of turning on the laptop is awful. It\u2019s like we get 2 lousy days off and one of them has to be spent worrying about work again.",

            "I used to have the \"Sunday Scaries\" so badly. Immense dread every day before my Monday. Did not want to go to work and start the week. Weekend wasn't long enough. Something bad was going to happen. \n\nNow that I've left that terrible company and work for an amazing company that cares about me and takes care of me, I seldom struggle with this particular issue anymore. I still don't want my weekends to end, because who doesn't like weekends? But I also enjoy my workweek now. \n\nThat said, my general anxiety isn't any better haha.",

Sometimes when I get locked in these negative cycles and I can't break out I will take a cold (COLD) shower, and it breaks the cycle. Like a shock to the system/ctrl-alt-del for my body.

Started taking magnesium oxide pretty consistently and noticed it does chill me out a bit but doesn\u2019t completely erase my anxiety symptoms. It works amazing for sleep if you take it at night. Only downside I had was I realized the oxide was messing with my stomach and I woke up every morning with stomach cramps and mild diarrhea (only happened once a day). After a while of just dealing with it so I could finish the bottle I realized that I was dehydrated and kind of dizzy getting headaches all the time. A little research told me that the stomach issues brought on by magnesium oxide can effect the way your body absorbs electrolytes, causing dehydration symptoms. Makes sense since my first bathroom trip of the day was always borderline diarrhea. After stopping magnesium I felt a lot better after a few days. My dizziness was gone and stomach issues subsided as expected if this was true. Switching to glycinate asap so I can still reap the benefit, just wanted to give my body a break since oxide didn\u2019t work out for me in terms of side effects.

And I got magnesium tablet 375Mg. Half an hour after taking them I could feel an amazing sense of relief. My heart rate had dropped from arround 120bpm (which was pretty consistent for me whilst being idle and laying on the couch) to arround 70-80bpm. The constant heart beat skipping stopped and I was just relaxing like crazy. It's been 2 days now of taking magnesium and some additional vitamins and my sleep was been way better too! \n\nI use a galaxy watch to track my sleep an monitor my sleeping stages and blood oxygen etc. \nThe blood oxygen was steady again without drops and my overal sleeping scores got above 80 again , I never seen those numbers! Most of the time I got a sleeping score of 50-60 . Please everyone that is searching for these threads and are unsure how to overcome their problems , give magnesium and vitamins a shot(especially B6) I finally feel like myself again, I used to constantly feel dissociated but it's all gone in a matter of hours/days! Don't get me wrong I'm still not 100% \"myself\" but I can finally focus on work and other stuff again without the constant suffering. \n\nThanks everyone for recommending this to me , just trying to \"pay it forward\" with this comment !",
            "Yes. I have been having trouble sleeping more than three or four hours a night. Finally decided to break down and invest in CALM magnesium gummies. I had to pee three times in less than three hours, AND also had to get up and poop, which is extremely abnormal for me since I always make sure to poop before going to sleep and I had done that before going to bed as well. \n\nThis has resulted in only two hours of sleep, and unfortunately, I was dumb enough to try this product on a morning of the night I have to work late as a DJ. So yes, my anxiety and mood are worse now, and I will be returning this sh't for a refund. \n\nSince I live with housemates there is no guarantee that I will even be able to sleep later today before work because they are sleeping now and once they are done sleeping, they get to decide in behalf of me whether or not I should have peace and quiet to sleep. Maybe the gummies will finally help me sleep as I am sitting in the car driving to or back from work later tonight though, but definitely not taking anymore because I do not like only being able to sleep two hours and then always feeling like the threat of diarrhea occurring preventing me from being able to eve attempt sleeping again. On top of that, I don't even know how safe magnesium is since people say \"too much is dangerous\" and no one seems to know what \"too much\" really is. Glad I took less than what was recommended because I could only imagine how much worse I would be right now if I took the dosage recommended on the bottle. Well, lesson learned for me.",

It\u2019s mostly stored (in our bones and somewhere else can\u2019t remember). \nSo blood levels reflect very little of your status. \nIt\u2019s well known that our food does not contain as much magnesium as it used to due to soil depletion. \n\nI supplemented with magnesium malate (from seeking health) for months before I felt I was replenished and felt like taking less (I never took the dose advised because I am quite sensitive). \n\nI had good results with glycinate in the past for sleep (some people reported adverse effect, something to do with glutamate). I avoid citrates. \n\nMagnesium is a pretty benign supplement (not sure about your heart problems or how it would interact); it would be hard to harm yourself with it (unlike say iron, vitamin A or even vitamin E) -the worse could be diarrhea. You could also deplete your calcium levels so you want to make sure you get enough calcium in your diet. \n\nTo summarize, I think it\u2019s ok to go with it, IMO. \nRule of thumb: get yourself a good enough supplement, with quality ingredients, easily absorbable, little or no fillers. Research the form you want. \nAlways start slow when you start anything new and increase your dose if that seems right.

I think my biggest issue is that people like to put a time limit on mental health, but everyone heals in their own time. It's like expecting someone with an injured leg to walk. And since its an invisible battle, a lot of people dont see the struggle. It may look like im doing well on the outside, but inside im fighting to be \"normal\" everyday. \n\nI don't think I can work anymore because I tend to have panic attacks and call out often because of my anxiety, but even if I got a job, one isn't enough and I cannot work two. My mental health just won't allow it. I had a phone interview the other day, but I didn't answer because of my anxiety. I was on Lexapro for about eight months, but decided to go off of it because I don't like the numb feeling it gives me. After my last job, which was in a call center, I think it was the straw that broke the camels back due to the nature of the job. I can't handle talking to people as much anymore and get anxiety anytime the phone rings. I also find it difficult talking to anyone as well, so sometimes I get pretty lonely, but I've felt like that around people as well. \n\nSometimes it's difficult for me to go outside so I feel like I'm developing agoraphobia. It's easier when I go with someone or listen to music or an audiobook, but I try to avoid going out as much as possible. \n\nI don't really watch movies and TV shows as much anymore.

I had a job for like 4 years and made friends and had a relationship and all that is gone and I still don't have a car. Or money. I have nothing. Still living with toxic family. I don't have friends but the ability to escape in a car would really help. Owning a car is super expensive though.",

            "Having a job really helps me. I was like that for years in college. I skipped pretty much every class and wouldn\u2019t go shopping for basic needs like food or hygiene, basically just programmed all day and was incredibly anxious. After graduation, I had a mental episode turned me bipolar 1, was hospitalized and doing the job search. Couldn\u2019t find work so took up a retail gig. It wasn\u2019t ideal, I need to make more money, but it was something. And idk being in front of people all day interacting has really helped. Still though on my off days I regress into my isolative ways. I try not to let it get out of hand because then the anxiety comes back and I won\u2019t leave the house. I\u2019m trying to do \u2018experiments\u2019 on my off days just going in public somewhere doing something like eating at a restaurant or going shopping or going on walks to help break me out of it. I\u2019m medicated now as well so I\u2019m hoping that plus the experiments will help break the isolation side of me into something more extrovert idk we\u2019ll see",

            "I appreciate OP for starting this thread. I\u2019m rather new to Reddit so please bear with me as I come up to speed.  \n\nMy first impressions after joining this subreddit are that there are over 674K followers on r/Anxiety!  Wow\u2026and we come from all corners of the world and from all walks of life. Cool thing after reading the many topics is that  \u201cwe are not alone\u201d.  No matter what lies as root cause of our anxieties, the duration or extent of damage to our lives, additional symptoms we may encounter (depression, OCD, eating disorder, poor self esteem, phobia, suicide ideation, etc) one thing we all share in common is our understanding of the overwhelming fear, helplessness and crippling effect anxiety has had on our health and wellbeing.  Imagine if we had a magic wand to wipe away all of our pain and suffering, remove the barriers that prevent us from living the true depth, joy, and fulfillment we were meant to experience!  \n\nI like that OP has set the tone for community support here. Regardless of our individual circumstances we know that horrible despair people with this disorder feel and are too afraid to seek support from those around us. People who handle anxiety better may struggle to understand the challenges we face and dismiss us for being too weak or sensitive. Yet I\u2019m sure that we all have some strengths and capabilities, gifts and skillsets, things that we have accomplished quite well. \n\nI can\u2019t help but wonder if the collective knowledge of the 674k followers can be applied to help those of us who are at different stages of recovery. \n\nWhat does recovery look like?  What triggers our relapse?  What preventive measures can we take? Do we eventually learn to cope with setbacks, the awful anxiety attacks, find the right medication, exercise, therapist, supportive environment, etc.?  \n\nI suffered major depression and debilitating anxiety 20 yrs ago and still managed to work, raise my children, take care of my home all alone. Yet recent events at work caused me so much anguish that I decided to take extended leave. I began wanting to avoid anyone and anything that makes me feel uncomfortable for fear I\u2019d spiral down again. It has become a daily battle not to succumb to my fears and anxieties, and when a person is in his/her own isolated headspace, it can become harder and harder to acknowledge the small victories we overcame. \n\nSo let\u2019s ring that bell \ud83d\udd14 when we are able to celebrate smallest accomplishments and send our \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude4f to our community members when they need the extra boost to make them feel safe and supported. \n\nI am going to explore this old pod series by Drew Linsalata (link below, I hope it works!) and if anyone is interested in joining me, let\u2019s exchange thoughts, key takeaways and new \u201caha\u201d moments for your next journey!

I also make poor decisions when there's pressure and I don't think that's taken into consideration either, but I'm sure that's common with most people. \n\nI was originally going to live with my mother, who isn't good for my mental health, but I wouldn't have that pressure. I've lived with my aunt for a while, so from her perspective I'm sure it seems like she's given me enough time to prosper. I went to school when I officially moved in with her the first time, and I had health issues at one point that prevented me from working. I was practically bedridden. \n\nBut I've been pressured my entire life, so I think that may have had a bigger impact on my health than I or my family realizes. I don't have anywhere else I can move until I figure things out. I recently decided to stop talking to my mom until I get therapy, so i can navigate our relationship better. I'm in the process of getting one soon, so hopefully that works out. My plan is to try and start my own business so I can be self employed.

I thought it was just a temporary thing, so after getting my life together, going to therapy and tackling every demon I know of, I then got off my meds. A month later and my anxiety started peaking again. I tried exercise, eating right, meditating, taking nature walks, healthy distressing, etc. I love life and going out and doing things. But my anxiety is natural, and now I must explore getting on meds again. \n\nMeds may have some side effects, but so does not taking them.

Started having some digestive issues in OctoberGot down under 270 in November, did my taxes, and was supposed to file bankruptcy for a fresh start.

Now I\u2019ve had 4-5 episodes, anxiety is getting worse, to the point where I can\u2019t get out of bed today and Mom had to bring me food & water. Saw the doctor Friday, prescribed Zoloft which I\u2019m scared to take, and a PPI. Last 2 nights I have nonstop gas, and if I hold it my chest hurts. This is not normal.

Given all that, it's more than reasonable to think that that'd make me depressed at least some of the time.

            "I experience paranoia and delusions. My therapist says they\u2019re most likely connected to my anxiety. My anxiety can get so intense without reason that my mind essentially makes some shit up for me to be scared of. Most of my delusions revolve around being watched, observed, or monitored.",
            "Yeah for me depression is like I don\u2019t care about going to the grocery store bc I don\u2019t care if I even eat. Whereas anxiety is like I\u2019m scared to go to the store rn because (insert illogical reasons).",
            "I come across it occassionally, but I never get to stay there.",
            "I'm talking about diagnostic criteria.  It's possible because depression/low mood doesn't need to exist to have an anxiety disorder",
            "You\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s a pain. I think by my 3rd follow up, after therapy, he was able to listen. You need to REALLY stress what\u2019s going on with you. I had to stress to him that I had had these issues ALL of my life, and I wasn\u2019t \u201cdepressed\u201d as a child. Some of the meds treat anxiety and depression, but some meds only work for depression, and that\u2019s where the issues are. You know how you truly feel, so just keep expressing that.",
            "I\u2019ll never get over it. I use Strattera for ADHD, Viibrid, Valium (as needed), and Propranalol 1-2xs daily, for GAD/OCD (intrusive thoughts). Valium wasn\u2019t enough some days (peopling/extreme stress), so I had to add the Propranolol. It\u2019s a cocktail, but it seems to be working. I can feel my heart attempt to race, but it doesn\u2019t quite go there, so that\u2019s a nice change. It sounds like a lot of meds that most people would just say breathe, go for a walk, or just distract yourself, but that doesn\u2019t work every time or even for everyone, and that\u2019s ok.",
            "In a loose sense, it does. For me. I don't begin to lose my grip on reality I always know what's real but when the anxiety gets really bad, what I know to be real no longer has the same look or feel anymore and it confuses me. Especially since a lot of my anxiety is drawn from dwelling too heavily in the future or the past. I play things over and over in my head until it just doesn't look right anymore. Doesn't look like my life anymore. It becomes disfigured and distorted. Distances of time begin to dilate and contract. A year ago, I will feel like yesterday. Two months from now, I will feel like it's coming up tomorrow. \n\nSo, not in the exact sense, but yeah, a type of delusion I would posit.",
            "That sounds more like dissociation than delusion. I get both, and tbh delusion is VERY different from dissociation and is entirely separated from GAD",
            "Ive been trying to explain this to myself and this makes sense. Thank you.",
            "A delusion would be like thinking you're God, invisible, and thus you jump from a 50 ft story building thinking you'll survive. Or something like thinking the TV is sending you personal messages so they talk back to the TV. Or thinking that their house is tapped so they constantly search for cameras. People with delusions can't tell apart their delusions from reality. You seem to have good enough insight to realize that something is wrong with your thoughts. People with delusions can't do that.",
            "Fair point you could have. GAD, however, in my experience, can build into a nervous frenzy, leading to the dissociation. So GAD while different can absolutely in my experience serve as a catalyst to dissociation.",

I have no medical history of heart issues. I'm young and take care of myself  good diet, regular exercise. Heart healthy supplements. Blood pressure normal. Blood oxygen normal. \n\nBut I can't seem to convince myself I'm not dying from heart failure. \n\nDelusion?",

            "Well that only happens when the GAD bubbles up. I spend most ly days ruminating constantly about past and future. State of health state of the world state of everything really. \n\nThat's my baseline anxiety. \n\nOnce in a while that sort of elevates to this whole other type of epsiode where my mind has now taken control and become my enemy. usually as a result of not enough sleep from shift work. And then I'm in something else entirely. But it tends to manifest from the usual smaller anxiety that I just deal with and manage. My operational anxiety level if you will lol.",

I am devastated and sad my dad is gone, but I am also relieved that he is not suffering in old age. Enjoy the time you have, go make memories and celebrate each other! But you may be able to find some peace in the idea that by the time they do actually pass away everyone may be ready in ways you aren\u2019t right now.",
            "i\u2019m the same way. i remember being as young as 6 years old and the realisation would keep me crying in the bed all night. the thought feels like death to me honestly.",
            "Unfortunately it\u2019s just the reality of life as we know it: death is inevitable for every single person and earthly creature, always has been, and always will be. \n\nBut instead of focusing on that, just focus on making the most of the time we have with our loved ones, making good lasting memories and strengthening our bonds.\n\nWhen the day comes that you have to say goodbye to a parent, you\u2019ll likely be a lot more ready than you are now. It\u2019s a bridge we all have to cross eventually, but over the years you\u2019ll become stronger and more able to handle it. But given your age, that shouldn\u2019t be any time soon.\n\nIt\u2019s natural to feel this way something but don\u2019t let your fear of the inevitable get in the way of the love you share with them today. The most harmful thing would be if that fear damages your ability to continue to share the love and the bond that you value. So I guess my advice would be to focus on the present, and try to enjoy life one day at a time. If everybody spent their lives worried about their inevitable death (or that of their loved ones), the earth would be full of nothing but sadness and misery. But instead we can be strong, acknowledge the inevitable, but not allow it to destroy the quality of life and relationships we have today, and continue to enjoy the time we have with our loved ones.\n\nEdit: also therapy is good and helpful and I recommend it",

Driving my grandpa to hospital for cancer, infection that he can\u2019t get rid of etc. \n\nHelping out made me realise i had spent alot of time with my family and they knowing that was enough. That combined with doing chores for family made me exhausted over the thought of how much i put in with no return and that if they die it would be bad, but still less of a burden for me (i know that sounds bad). \n\nDo enough for them that you feel you can live your own life with no worries.",

My parents are still in their forties but, with every year that passes, the fear grows that they can die.

It hurt me a lot to see him sick. \n\nAfter his loss, I bonded with my brothers and nieces. I did not know them as my brothers had lost touch with him for years. \n\nThis minimized the pain to some extent, bonding with new persons. And then as time goes on, it still hurts me to this day that I cannot bring out a certain aspect of my personality HE only brought out. \n\nBut life goes on. You have to surround yourself by caring people who make life as enjoyable as possible.\n\nDoes it get better with age ? In my experience not much. I am super scared of losing my mother but I find comfort, in being there for people I love, knowing I can have some form of a positive impact on other's people lives is what keeps me going on most days :) \n\nYou're not alone !",

He had to have surgery, go through rehab and home therapy, ironically all the exact same things I do for my job as an OT. That accident was the first time the illusion that my parents were immortal and untouchable was shattered. Luckily, my dad made a full recovery, but still. I feel like I know too much, especially now that they\u2019re 65+. I know every single bad thing or outcome that could happen to them, because I see it every single day with my job.

I'm in good health, though, whereas my mother has mobility, gastrointestinal, and heart issues. My father happens to be amazing at 80, a little overweight, some partially clogged arteries, but he exercises regularly, takes medications, and he's under the care of a doctor, so he's out every day running errands, etc. Neither of my parents has dementia.\n\nStill, they sat me down recently to have their 'end of life' talk with me. They are being so brave about it. They have set up a Special Needs Trust for me because I'm disabled. When they are both gone, they will have an estate agency come into their home, appraise everything, sell it, and then return the proceeds to my trust. During this talk with my parents, it was all I could do not to fall out of my chair sobbing. But I did my best to hold myself together for their sake.\n\nI recently learned of a term called 'anticipatory grief'. It helped me to read about it. To know there's a name for how much I'm grieving before they have actually died.\n\nAnother thing I do is remind myself that it's okay to be sad and scared about my parents dying. Anxiety disorder or not, having to face the death of our parents and closest loved ones is a universal human experience. For many, if not most of us, our parents' deaths is beyond devastating to imagine. \n\nSo normalizing the way I'm feeling, taking the anxiety diagnosis part of it out the equation and just recognizing my common humanity is giving me a lot of comfort.",

I don't think about it because even now it's a miracle she's alive due to a tumor in the middle of her brain. I've learned to eventually accept that death comes and you can't stop it.

            "Becoming aware of death, and the reality that the people you love will die, and then being sad about it is really normal.  Both my parents and I are deeply religious, but I've still cried over the inevitability of their deaths (just because we know that we will only be saying goodbye for a little while, that 'little while' will still be several decades, during which we will not see or hear from each other at all).  Overall, though, it's been a positive thing. It gave me more respect and sympathy for what they went through taking care of their own parents and the way that they handled it after grandma and grandpa passed on. Knowing that I and my parents are mortal has made me more present in where we are now, because even though we will be together in heaven, we only get these moments we have now once. \nThat said, the feeling of sadness that comes from just being away from your parents will get better the more you spend time away from them. If you didn't have (successful) practice spending time away from your parents as a kid (like at a sleepover or summer camp), then it will be hard at first. Don't get discouraged, and don't feel bad about spending time away from your family. It's healthy to build a life separate from your parents - and separate doesn't have to mean 'in conflict' or 'totally apart' like it does for some people who have bad relationships with their family. It just means that you have your things that you do and your own goals to pursue and your own relationships to build (like with your boyfriend). And the cool thing about *that* is that there is a whole other (amazing) aspect of a person's relationship with their parents that can only develop once they've launched out in life. I encountered a whole 'nother side (it was a good one) of my parents after I moved out, and I'm so glad I got to mature my relationship with them in that way.",
            "I lost both of mine and it gets easier eventually.",
            "This. All the time",
            "Oh, yes. The pain and anxiety of such a thought struck me when I was literally 10. In the end, I was able to overcome it by being determined to care for my parents in their own elderly days.",
            "Nah, they already dead. \n\nSome fears are a blessing to have.",
            "I miss my dad so much. He died a couple years ago and I think of him everyday. I could really use him right now while going through a huge life change. I\u2019m scared and have no one to talk to or get advice from. I learned a lot from his passing and have lived life in a much better way since, but I still would rather have my dad with me today",
            "I felt this way for a long time, living on my own was the only way for force myself to get over my separation anxiety if my mom, it eventually moves ok to something else. I still worry and get scared of my mom dying all the time, and in excess I think this is normal for everyone.\n\nMy separation anxiety is now in my bf and I cry regularly scared one day I'll get a call he died in a car accident or something tragic. It's horrible and it is stemmed around paranoia and anxiety and therapy and finding coping skills to get your mind off said things will tremendously help you have to find happiness in being away from you parents and knowing it'll be okay.\n\nI was never huge in religion but I've turned to Christianity for it has helped me in many ways before and praying to God that my parents stay safe and that garudian angels keep close always make the world lift off my shoulders. \n\nMy mom lives on her own with health problems in the ghetto but I can't live with her due to her lease agreements and I do actively worry about her getting broken into (it's a shady wide of town) or her having another stroke or heart attack and no one knowing a thing. I'll go as far as spamming her and going to check on her when im scared.\n\nSome of its anxiety, some of its natural love and protection from a child to their parents.",
            "I have, I was tearing up every time I thought about it...\n\nBeing in a relationship has made me feel stronger, that I think I could deal with it when it happens. I've also learned to apreciate them more.\n\nI feel like I dealt with the worst of it, kind of like I've already mourned them.",
            "Same for me, my parents are in their 70s, so I know it might come rather sooner than later and some days it really depresses me. We discuss nearly every day and even though I live far away from them I like to visit them and hang out with them. I often think about how all alone I will feel when they won\u2019t be here anymore. Who will I message when I have something I want to share ? It really depresses me some times I dont know how to get over this feeling. I\u2019m also sad that one might pass leaving the other alone for a while, I know it will be so hard for them.",
            "I'm 50 and lost my father already, still have my mother. I would tell you two things. The first is that your fear of losing them in your case is clearly related to the fact that you have such a great relationship with them. That is something very good, that not everyone has, so enjoy it fully and be happy for it. The second one is that, yes, it does improve with age. I used to feel the same, and I would guess many people do as they are young. One of the main ways in which it improves is that you will likely establish a strong relationship with a man, which will likely be the nucleus of a new family, or else you may have something else in your life as important as that. In either case it should make your parents somewhat less central in your life than they were as you were a child and still are now. That's how it should be as you become an adult. So, that may be one more good reason for you to go forward and establish such a relationship (or some other important endeavor) and become an adult, as it will solve this otherwise insurmountable problem.",
            "I get this feeling too and it scares the living daylight out of me Everytime I have to think about this. I just want to be with them at the last time and I just wish that they should not suffer at that time from any hard pain or something like that..I wish I am stable enough to be there for them and support them with all I have.",
            "This is so relatable. My parents are about to turn 60 and it\u2019s all I\u2019ve thought about for the past few years. I don\u2019t know why I worry so much, they\u2019re perfectly healthy - in fact I\u2019d go so far as to say they\u2019re healthier than me. But this \u201canticipatory grief\u201d is taking over my mind and I hate it. They\u2019re my best friends and the thought of the love and safety they provide just being gone one day terrifies me.",
            "my grandmother and mom had alzheimers and dementia, I used to have anxiety about losing my parents. But weirdly enough seeing my mom slowly dissapear felt better than sudden. When my uncle took his own life I broke down hard, when my grandmother died I didnt know what to feel. But its okayt take a breather",
            "My mother died when I was 11 and my father has dementia and is married to a wench. I've kinda just accepted things for the way they are.",
            "I started thinking about this recently. I\u2019m 24 and my dad is 66, I just got married but I\u2019m making the most of visiting when they are in town and traveling to them (they live out of the country). My biggest fear isn\u2019t his passing, but that I won\u2019t have kids to grow up in time to remember my old man. Best role model for me and i want my kids to see the same too, but we are not ready for kids but fear time isn\u2019t gonna wait for us either",
            "I\u2019m exactly the same way, I can\u2019t cope with knowing that everyone I love will inevitably die. It makes me really sad and anxious and I don\u2019t know how to cope with it",
            "No - I feel resigned and sad. For you, it might get better with time.",
            "I am also not religious so death for me is terrifying. I worry about my cat, my parents, and especially my brother. That being said, I took a ethics class and we went over all of the different philosophies, but one stuck with me was some dude who said, it was just more suffering to fear death before it comes. It will but till then it\u2019s our job to enjoy our time with people without additional the suffering and fear of worrying about death. Like all philosophy it\u2019s easy to say, hard to do. But it has helped me when I get particularly upset. I\u2019m sorry your struggling so hard with this.",
            "I do! I've always been close with my parents but I lost two grandparents during covid (not to covid itself) and it really drove home that one day I'd be in my parents shoes and at their funeral, the same way they were at their own parents funeral.\n\nI live about 2 hours away from my folks, but I talk to them on the phone a lot and I always make an effort to spend time with them when we can. It makes me really sad to think about, but I also try to use it as motivation to make as many happy memories together.",
            "Nope.... Both my parents are horrific and horrendous individuals. My father never paid child support and exploited, used, stole from us and my mother is probably the most malacious, malevolent, cruel person I've ever know. When they're finally gone... Good riddance...",
            "All the time. My stepmom had brain cancer so I know the inevitable is coming soon and I just get so terrified. Then I start to worry about my dad, who is almost 70, which leads me into worrying about my mom and my stepdad\u2026until it snowballs.",
            "you are not alone. this is a thought that has crossed my mind more recently as my in laws are approaching 70 and its uncomfortanle for me to think about. I am not close with my mother, and my dad died when I was a kid, so...i know that loosing a parent is painful but loosing them in adulthood is also hard. I have been with my husband almost 20 years (married for 8 of them) so I lovee my inlaws. \n\nJust apprecite the time you have, be grateful that you have loving parents.\n\nugh....",
            "I'm surprisingly okay with it",
            "When I was in 6th grade I had a teacher who\u2019s mother was dying of cancer and she would cry about it almost every day in class. I started obsessing about my own parents passing away and I\u2019d cry every night and have nightmares that my parents were dying. I suffered so much and 15 yrs later they\u2019re still here lol. Over time I\u2019ve come to accept it. My mom is sick right now she\u2019s on dialysis I can see in how much pain she\u2019s in and how it takes a toll on her body. I think if she passed it wouldn\u2019t upset me as much because she would no longer be in the conditions she\u2019s in. We just have to make the best of the time now because I\u2019m reality you\u2019ll never know when it happens.",
            "100 percent relate!",
            "I was always SO annoyed by kids that would leave sleepovers because they missed their parents so it\u2019s funny now that I\u2019m 27, I miss my parents every week. I will say as you get older and move invested in your own life by means of education, career, your own family etc. the anxiety does dissipate. Something that comforts me is being sure that I will absolutely take care of my parents in old age just as they cared for me as a child. Hopefully I can repay them for the memories they gave me as a kid. And until they pass I will ensure they\u2019re comfortable and safe by any means necessary. One day we will join them again, not sure where or how, but I know that we are here together for a reason, just as we will be once we die. Part of the reason my fianc\u00e9 and I decided on having kids was because we love our parents so much that when they pass, we want to be able to host our kids just as our parents do now.",
            "Just yesterday, my dad took me to lunch, and he casually started talking about how he and my mom had updated their will, and some of the details. We've never broached this subject before, and I felt caught off-guard. I recognize why end-of-life preparations are important to discuss, but thinking of my parents dying makes me anxious.\n\nI'm worrying about work and health stuff, too ... so this convo made it all the harder to keep the lid on my anxiety last night and today.",
            "Lots of people become demented and/or physically incapacitated in their 80s. After enough time dealing with that, you may look forward to yr parents demise, no matter how much you loved them previously.",
            "I feel like this sometimes. The thought of my parents not being around one day really crushes me and I hate it. I just know that when the day comes that they are both gone, it's going to destroy me. I try and focus on reminding myself that they are still here, and should be for a good few years yet, and that instead of focusing on what will happen when they're not here, focusing on enjoying the time they still are.",
            "I have kinda the same feeling. The worst part is that you know that these thoughts are wrong and you should use this time to enjoy their company. And it is an infernal loop. \nMeditating helped me a lot dealing with these thoughts to accept them but let them go away without paying attention to it. Like sitting on a bench and looking at the cars passing.",
            "For me, it really isn\u2019t what I\u2019m worry about, as much as it is constant. When I\u2019m relived that my anxiety is incorrect, and there is no longer worry, I switch to something else. It\u2019s freaky debilitating. It took lots of work on my end to get to, what I consider, a manageable life. Medication (busbar for me) counseling, and MEDITATION ( which was terrible the first couple month I started) is how I found some peace. Everyone situation is different, and there is no set answer, but I will say, hoping it just goes away will probably be a pretty agonizing journey. Good Luck. I wish you that absolute best!!\u2764\ufe0f",

            "Just to add to what you said;  \nMy father passed away 2 years ago, suddenly, he was alive and normal by 9am and at 11am he was pronounced dead. i was allowed to see him at the morgue because it was so sudden i didn't have time to say anything to him, no one did.  \ni live my life thinking that everyday could be the last, since that day happened, i just try to try my best at loving the ones i care about and the ones i don't even know much about. life is worth living this way, and if i die the same way my father did, i would be happy with what i did in my life.",
            "This is probably the best way to handle this. I am sorry for your loss my friend.\n\nI don't get anxiety from the thought of my parents going but as the inch closer to when my grandparent died on both sides of the family, the more those thoughts enter my mind. Accepting the inevitable is the only choice we all have.",

            "Same. My grandma (who was my maternal figure to me) dies of breast cancer when I was 5 (nearly 6) and ever since then I haven't been able to stop worrying about everyone I love dying before I do. When I was a teenager and attempted suicide a few times, at least one of them was becausw I preferred dying right there and then to one day experiencing the feeling of loss again. I still feel like I'd prefer to die first. Holding a photo album full of dead people is my greatest fear.",

            ">if they are gone I will follow because life to me is my family.\n\nI don't know how old you are, and if you have kids, but \"your family\" may become the one you create, rather than the one in which you were created. That is precisely why losing one's parents is not the same when we are a child or when we are adults. Even if you don't create your own family, you may have something in your life of similar importance. If you don't, and you are still your parents' child primarily and will remain so for all your life, then yes, it may be a large problem to lose them, but it would only be a consequence of the larger problem of \"remaining a child\" all your life.",

So I wouldn\u2019t worry about it because lots of things can get you before old age.\n\nWhile I want to assume your heart's in the right place, telling people with anxiety \"not to worry\" about it is like saying \"just don't feel pain\" from someone with a freshly broken leg.\n\nAn anxious mind wanders whether we want it to or not, regardless of how probable an event actually is. All we can do is figure out how to best cope with our struggles on a daily basis.\n\nFor some, this might mean therapy, and for others it might mean medication. For me, it means spending as much time with close friends / family as possible before they're gone.\n\n_Easier said than done when my depression driven by AuDHD and BPD tendencies makes hugging and saying I love them difficult. (Some nights I want nothing more than to say \"you busy?\" to a friend, hop in the car, drive to their house, hug them for 5 minutes, then drive home.)_\n\nAnywho, your sentiment about the possibility of losing a significant other or friend closer to our age before our parents is so true.

The music is amazing and relaxing.\n\nOthers that I've played to relax:\n\nHouse Flipper: Another example where nothing get frustrating but still gives you satisfaction. You buy houses, go there, clean, fix stuff, paint, decorate and sell to people. There's expansions about gardening, cyberpunk, pets and a farm one coming.\n\nUnpacking: Tells you a story while putting you in different apartments and you have to unpack and place every item in the room. For some reason it's super relaxing haha, I've played this one a few times.\n\nDorfromantik: You make islands with hexagonal pieces that ideally have to match by type. You can unlock more types and go pretty big.\n\nCult of the Lamb: Dungeon exploring while you have a cult of... lambs. The graphics and animations are super cute, the music is amazing and the game is hilarious.

L-Theanine will even help balance the neurotransmitters in the brain...i.e. serotonin and dopamine.  B-Complex, amino acids complex, particularly L-Phenylalanine,  L-Tryptophan, and L-Methionine (low mg w/b complex) is also a great help in keeping depression away.  You're very smart and sensitive to the Spirit as in being hesitant about antidepressant medication - yes harmful side effects.  I would strongly suggest natural remedies, and see what helps you the best as each person is different.  Ginger is excellent in calming down an upset stomach.  If you need an extra help with the tea, I personally take 1 Swanson Ginger Root capsule daily to keep nausea away as a preventative.  Works like a charm. If there comes a time I need extra help, I'll just take an extra capsule that day, along with peppermint candy and the nausea is gone in no time.  But again everyone's different.  I've felt all these feelings before, and it was a long battle, and how I made it through was praying my way through, along with perseverance, learning, researching, and experimenting my way into natural supplements that could help me physically and mentally.

            "I\u2019ve always said this! I would take miserable depression over crippling anxiety any day. As another person said, at least with depression, I can just chill in bed, sleep, watch TV, play on my phone. Anxiety encompasses everything I do - eat, sleep, concentrate, relax.",

            "Some trauma therapy people ask the question \"Would you be willing to experience anxiety for a while if that's what it takes to let go of the depression symptoms?\"  It's a good question for me to remember since I used to be more depressed and now have more anxiety!  \n\nI guess I'd say depression = maybe more PEACE and less potential ALIVENESS and anxiety = definitely less PEACE and potential for ALIVENESS (except the aliveness is hard is somehow too much for us to handle).  \n\nAnyway I agree that depression is actually less uncomfortable than anxiety in the short-run.  I think for me on my path I can see a way out of anxiety that integrates the benefits (i.e. more energy and aliveness).  Without seeing that path, thinking that anxiety will be uncomfortable for forever then I can definitely understand the preference for depression.",
            "Not weird at all. I've felt that quite a bit over the last few months. Depression and I are old friends that I know how to deal with. \n\nThis anxiety is like depression at a hundred miles an hour only much louder.",
            "Least while being depressed i don\u2019t get anxiety or panic attacks",

            "I\u2019ve been depressed before. I would much much rather being depressed over this stupid anxiety",
            "No way. I've had both and depression made me want to actually die. Now with anxiety I'm deathly afraid to die. Although it's a coping mechanism, I'm productive and at least do well professionally with anxiety. depression would have ended my life",
            "You could be like me and be both at times...I'm just that lucky (and I may use sarcasm as a defense mechanism)!",
            "Yes, I would prefer to have depression than anxiety.\n\n\nIn the past, I had a depressive episode that lasted for months. Honestly, I felt much more at peace with myself during that time. I could go about my daily activities without constantly worrying about the future.",
            "I personally do not find this weird. Downright fear is the worst feeling in my opinion, and i have both depression and anxiety as well. Nothing beats just plain fucking fear.",
            "It's definitely not weird. I have always thought, \"If i had 3 wishes, i would use 1 to wish away my anxiety disorder, even if that meant keeping my other mental illnesses.\"\n\nAnxiety is my least favorite feeling",

            "Yes! I'd rather be depressed than anxious. The highs of anxiety freak me out.\n\nI'd rather be on the lows of depression. So if I had to choose, that would be my poison.",
            "i've had both and i've always said i'd choose depression over anxiety. mind you my depression was pretty bad. and at the time i also suffered from undiagnosed anxiety. \nbut nothing compares to real anxiety for me. having GAD is so so hard. i'd choose pointless days and sleepless nights over panic attacks and feeling like i'm dying every day i live.",
            "I\u2019d choose anxiety. Anxiety makes life very hard. Depression makes it borderline impossible.  People kill themselves from depression not just anxiety.",
            "You're on an anxiety sub.  You'll get the answer that you want.  Go ask it in the depression sub and you'll get a very different answer.  Your anxiety is obviously worse than your depression.",
            "This is how I am. I do not leave my house bc of the anxiety and I race home. My depression at home to me feels safer than being anxious and out of the house. I only leave my house for work.",
            "Yes. I have always had anxiety since very young. Constant anxiety. Anxious about everything as long as I can remember and thought other people also live like that. \n\nDepression creeps in and out all throughout my life too. \n\nBetween severe depression and severe crippling anxiety, I would definitely rather have depression. \n\nI think depression = i always have an option to end things.. although that sounds bad, i am not that bothered by it\n\nBut anxiety is just simply unbearable. There\u2019s no other way to describe it.",
            "No absolutely not. With depression you are just trying to get through the day whereas anxiety can absolutely ruin you.",
            "I felt this on a whole other level. I had depression in 2021 and that does nothing compared to what I have now. Depression I had no motivation, no energy, I would just watch tiktoks and lay in bed. And eventually that went away naturally when I started going to the gym. However, anxiety affected my sleep, my appetite, my mood swings. I had a sensitized nervous system. I had physical symptoms of pain that the anxiety was causing me. I also had impending doom and intrusive thoughts. It was so bad compared to depression.",
            "I have a friend who up until recently had severe depression. Like \"the world could be on fire and i wouldn't care\" depression. I found myself being so jelous of her so many times because I would much rather be emotionally constipated than be in a constsnt state of fear and worry 24/7",
            "Definitely, being depressed sucks but anxiety is crippling",
            "I\u2019d choose depression all day every day. Both can be crippling. I have suffered from both and I can confidently say that for me, anxiety is much harder to deal with.",
            "I can relate. I have bipolar and I'd rather be depressed than manic.",
            "I relate sooooo much to this, yes anxious is WAY MORE dreadful physically and mentally rather than depression\u2019s impact being mostly mentally",
            "This is the one safety net my anxiety provides me. Sometimes when I start getting anxious, it will slowly intensify more and more. Imagine a light bulb that starts getting too much power. It\u2019s brighter and brighter until pop. That\u2019s me and my anxiety, except my pop is depression. For the next couple of days, I\u2019m just completely disassociated and on auto pilot. Then I slowly start \u201cbooting up\u201d again and come back to my normal self. Weird?",
            "Depression is worse, in my opinion. The feeling of having no hope and thinking of suicide on a daily basis is a terrible feeling.  \nAnxiety can also be debilitating, but for me,\nI would rather have that feeling of raging emotions, panicking because then I would feel something",
            "I think it's the other way around for me. I've been thinking about it a lot lately as I've been coming out of a pretty awful depressive period, which I'm really happy about but can't ignore the fact that my anxiety tends to increase the less depressed i am. Does anyone else experience that? It's like when I'm depressed, I don't care about anything and have no aspirations so there isn't much to be anxious about. The biggest thing i noticed was how different i felt when interacting with people while very depressed. Normally, I'm extremely socially anxious and on edge while talking to anyone. During that period, I couldn't give two fucks about what they were saying or how I was going to reply, I was just on autopilot and felt barely any hesitation in talking to people. Theoretically that sounds nice but it scared me a lot because of how unlike me it was. I don't think it was healthy. Now that I'm returning to my usual heavily anxious state, I think I'd much rather be here. Even though it's often debilitating, I actually have hope, things I want to do, dreams, and things that I care about. Not having any of those was really terrifying and I would never choose that over my incredibly anxious but at least caring self.",
            "I've had crippling anxiety from freshman year of high school up until like 21, im 22 now. I've FINALLY found some techniques that actually work for me. It's still a daily struggle, but its better than it's ever been. Never had too much experience with depression tho. Some therapists think I have it while others didn't mention depression in me tho. But I've always wondered what was worse. I kinda assumed it was depression but I don't think I have that, so I can't really compare.",
            "Same. My depression is easier for me than my anxiety. Ive heard people have similar sentiments in tbe opposite direction. \n\nIt may just be because my anxiety is pretty severe but my depression is not.",
            "I had depression caused by a medication and I just felt a void inside. Anxiety is absolutely horrible and I am sick of feeling scared and shaky constantly but I have the drive to get through it and I want to defeat it. In my good moments I feel like it sucks but I can do hobbies that do make me feel a little better. With depression nothing gave me pleasure at all, I didn't want to do anything, eat anything, everything felt totally futile and I just didn't want to be.",
            "Not at all. They\u2019re both bad but anxiety is a bitch. Getting in the way of me being social way more than depression ever has.",
            "No it\u2019s not I feel the same way",
            "I\u2019m the same way. Give me depression any day over anxiety.",
            "no",
            "No it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t like the feeling of being shaky and heart pounding and panic attacks etc. i rather feel empty and low than to go through that (anxiety)",
            "I\u2019d rather be anxious. I know how to bring myself down, but for me personally it\u2019s 10x harder to bring myself up. Plus I can use my anxiety & the (nervous) energy it brings, to get things accomplished. Hard for me to find the motivation to do anything on the days where I can\u2019t even get out of bed \ud83e\udd15",
            "Ive been depressed and anxious my whole life at 32.  \nLast month, things were going well when my prayer life was building well.  \nThen doubts kicked in and questions came.\n\nI became depressed for a month but found myself the will to live again.  \nBut holy fudge, my anxiety is back at it.  \nThough its not as terrible as it was when i had ocd along with it.\n\nJust wishing i wont ever have the need to drink myself to sleep",
            "I feel like you're really underplaying what depression does to some people. Depression isn't chillin in bed playing games and watching tv. It's slowly losing the desire to do anything. It's losing all joy from your previously favorite hobbies. It's wanting to die 24/7. It's feeling completely numb, enjoying nothing, isolating yourself from others while quietly desperate for any kind of help to make your brain stop wanting to die. \n\nNot saying anxiety isn't similarly horrible to deal with but I'm surprised here of all places to see someone brushing past depression like it would be a walk in the park compared to it.",
            "Yeah this exactly",
            "ya my anxiety is the opposite of yours, all the \u201caliveness\u201d which my brain actually translates to \u201csomething is extremely deathly wrong\u201d and i feel like im in danger and need to hide in my bed until the feeling goes away. definitely a freeze response",
            "I\u2019m the opposite I think. I\u2019ve had anxiety since like age 3, usually a constant low burn rather than panic/acute attacks. So I think I\u2019m more accustomed to that, personally, and am more distressed by depressive symptoms. I find it easier to breathe and get out of anxious feelings than to flip my mood. I spiral into uncontrollable sadness and cry a lot, can\u2019t see the bright side.",
            "until you get so depressed you don\u2019t even know what\u2019s real or what you\u2019re capable of doing to yourself or others, than you get real fucking anxious and panic",
            "Your anxiety pushes you to do things? Mine pushes me to do nothing, keep more still, move less, do less, be less. Because thats the only way to stop triggering my anxiety. I do things despite my anxiety not because of it and some days I cant do it at all because its so bad. \n\nMy depression doesnt stop me from doing things, it just makes me lose my drive to want to do things. Doing things is actually a lot easier when Im depressed than when Im anxious, because when Im depressed I dont care and so I can do things and it feel like a fever dream and in a way it deels like Im not actually doing them, like im not there, im a shell of a human then. When Im anxious the amount of care I have is so overwhelming that its incredibly difficult to do the things I desperatley want to do.",
            "I think both make me completely freeze a lot so I\u2019d rather freeze depressed than panicking but my anxiety is so not controlled (neither is my depression for that matter)",
            "Yeah i think you might have the healthy answer \ud83d\udc9c I\u2019d rather wanna kms with depression than have bad anxiety \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48",
            "Depends on the day \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 rn it is but tomorrow it could flip or be both who knows",
            "How do you cope?",
            "I agree!!",
            "I had a very deep depression a few years ago where deep down, I wanted to die to make all my problems go away. Today, it's the opposite; I have a tremendous fear of death and just want that fear to go away.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's funny how life takes many turns.",
            "Oh, I feel/experience all of those things when I\u2019m depressed. It\u2019s just 100000x more tolerable than anxiety to me.",
            "I've experienced the lowest lows of depression but even then I made better choices and was more functional than in states of manic anxiety.",
            "freeze?  interesting.  \n\nohhh...like uncomfortable sensations and yet you can't really move?  if that's it...yeah that is a very uncomfortable place to me\n\nfor me...anxiety now just drives me to walk to walk a lot...which is different from freeze.  still uncomfortable but less so.",
            "you know, if you have heard of Somatic Experiencing at all...it occurs to me that there might be some \"over-coupling\" here.  (SE isn't my top choice these days but this concept is named in that modality.)  You have a sensation in your body.  And you have some sense of \"something is extremely deathly wrong.\"  They're \"coupled\" but on some level you might be able to practice sensing between one versus the other of those.  If you feel that that's \"safe\" and not going to make you feel worse than you already feel.  But like..\"how do I feel the sensation, neutrally, in my body?\"  And \"how do I feel the sense that something is deathly wrong, is that meaning made somewhere specifically, different from the raw sensations in my body?\"  of course...I'm not a practitioner and just sharing from my experience and my reading and my own therapy, this is something that comes to mind.  (saw the email updates on this thread and it triggered this thought/idea so i came back to share)",
            "I mean when Im depressed I lose all care, which makes it impossible for me to be anxious. The moment I feel anxiety I know Im coming out of my depression and Ill likely have some really great days until anxiety starts debiliating me.",
            "Yup, mine also pushes me toward inaction. Avoidance and paralyzing anxiety\u00a0",
            "Might seem dumb saying it this way, but breathing is key. That, PAIRED with not caring if anyone sees you deep breathing in an unnatural way, and not caring what they think of you. Easier said than done.\n\nTry holding one side of your nostril, and leave the other nostril open. Breath in and out, then change sides, rinse and repeat. Again, easier said than done. Takes a lot of practice.\n\nIf you focus ALL or close to all of your attention ONLY on breathing, and thinking \"I deserve this breath, and this is going to be the one\", that will help. And even if that breath ISNT the one and it's a bad breath, keep saying that to yourself before you breath. You don't have to say \"this is gonna be a good breath\" every single time, but once in a while it helps.\n\nI also have a long list of things that help me breath (true breath, into lungs) on my old phone that isn't with me rn. Some of those things include:\n\nSinging (true singing, from the heart. It should feel almost natural and flowy, the singing, then once your done singing a line or two, take a breath)\n\nDrinking something so hot it almost hurts going down (this one might be dangerous)\nDrinking something REALLY cold\n\nCan't remember the other stuff but I'll update if I do, hope this helps, just keep trying\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nEdit: breathing out is also as important and breathing in. U can do that with the nostril technique as well. I notice when I exhale correctly, sometimes my anxiety will lower so quick that my body relaxes, and during the exhale I'll let out some snott by accident. Let it happen. Kinda gross, but it shows that your exhaling correctly, and that it's working for hour anxiety. Try to exhale naturally if you can, don't force it, however the body feels it needs to exhale.\n\nEdit: don't let snott come out in public tho, of course.",
            "I flip between wanting to be dead to being terrified about being dead. \n\nWhy does my brain do this. Its like ok youre gonna die, wait no take that back, I dont want to die. Well youve gotta live, wait no I dont want that one either! Like what does my brain want exactly? You cant be both alive AND dead and be neither of them all at the same time.",
            "Is anxiety a mechanism  of the ego to deal with depression? I mean  the mind that knows the depressed state would do anything to evade it? Not wanting to feel depressed is activating my fight or flight response?  I am fighting my own emotions now, rather than some wild creature.",
            "ya I have to force myself to go on a walk or do something. my brain gets into the delusion that it has to \u201cfix\u201d something, so it makes more sense to my anxious brain to lay in bed and think because anything else feels like i\u2019m wasting time. also if i\u2019m already feeling in danger the outside world just feels even more energetic and dangerous so i would rather be in bed where it\u2019s safe. doesn\u2019t help and would not recommend haha. i wish i had your response",
            "I have looked into this as well. My therapist has mentioned Somatic Experiencing as something we may do in the future. One thing I have been doing is meeting with kind of a guru who does a work called \u201cWholeness.\u201d The practice was curated by Connierae Andreas and its basically somatic experiencing but through a more spiritual practice. Even if you\u2019re not spiritual I definitely still think it\u2019s worth looking into as it has helped me feel my feelings from a more neutral perspective if that makes sense.",
            "THANK YOU. SO MUCH. SO SO SO SO MUCH",
            "I gotcha.  tbh this all makes me think more of complex ptsd.  your impulses are driving you at 2 different/opposite things at once.  to me that sounds related to disorganized attachment but that is a lot to try and unpack.  \n\nI don't want to send you down a rabbit hole you're not into.  it's hard to give good advice on it too.  but once I \"saw that\" in myself I couldn't not go down the rabbit hole.  it's hard to not just see it everywhere (many academics and therapists do believe the world is just full of traumatized people, as do i)\n\nif you want to feel depressed...maybe this \"tip\" can work.  when my anxiety was sky high in the c ptsd feeling sorta way...I just would get something to eat that would make me feel a bit stuffed.  packing on a few more pounds and feeling more stuffed was one way to shutdown the anxiety feels for me when it was super intense.  not sure if it works for you or is a worthwhile tradeoff...\n\nnowadays I've just started cutting caffeine and doing pmr 2x a day as described in a good I'm going through.  these feel good but not sure if they would help with the conflicting impulses you've got coming on...",

Not exactly what you were talking about, but I think more people have probably experienced this than they realize.\n\n\nPoor sleepers & insomniacs (oftentimes connected to anxiety) also apparently have been found to feel the emotional impact of past memories more strongly instead of being able to reflect objectively as the feelings fade.

I can usually remember enough to get by on school work but that's a little different because in does not always stick in the long term.

I fell into what I call a love affair with weed- at first it made me feel like a kid, with no anxiety. And then overtime it did the opposite. Around 4 months into this phase I started getting very depressed. That lasted until about a month ago- I can't remember exactly when it began even, so... My memory was definitely shot. People would ask me about conversations we had days before and I couldn't remember. Just had no idea what they were talking about. Since then, I've healed myself a lot. I still smoke now, but I have finally let go of why I loved weed in the first place, and now I've come to terms with how it currently is. I applied that rule to a lot of my life and suddenly, I'm not sure if this is placeabo- but my memory feels so much crisper. I do feel I regained my memory- but that may have just been lucky on my end. In all- stay hopeful. It might come back- just work with what you have and keep a nice goal in mind.",

            "Many things.\n\nMedication, for a time, to fight the panic attacks which surprise you every time.\n\nExercise, running mainly.\n\nNature walks, animals.\n\nThose were in the first phase healing from the shock and disruption.\n\nUnemployment was how all this could be done.\n\nIn the next recovery phase, was \"mindfulness meditation\" - basically watching the dysfunctional thoughts, identifying them, writing them down, giving logical rebuttals to the dysfunctions, reading up on other people's symptoms and coping mechanisms and then formulating a sort of daily affirmation / pledge which consisted of antidotes to each of dysfunctions.\n\nSo if the thoughts would become extremely complaining, I would counter it with facts of luck helping me out - that I was still luckier than 2 billion people, that I was luckier than all the animals and plants being killed or tortured daily, that I had a home and a family and food, clothing and shelter, that I should do something of my life rather than just sit crying about the loss of my glorious past, etc. \n\nI decided to be useful to _someone_ if not to myself the way I had planned for years.\n\nThe mindfulness was accompanied with volunteering at animal shelters, orphanages, and in general helping people out in whatever way I could. Again, unemployment made this possible. But it gave me much needed perspective. I am also biased towards the scientific temperament and so I read about evolution and studied the whole series of lucky events that bring me to be. It also helps to know that a dead Henry Ford is no better than a dead Somalian child soldier, which means that everyone is equally dead in 70 years and before and after the period of 70 years or whatever your life is, there is just nothing of value. \n\nHence, it is a good idea to make your life useful and positive to as many people or sentient creatures as possible. Pain and suffering reduction are worthy goals, if not extreme scientific or artistic accomplishment (because competition and pressure make you a handicapped person, relatively)\n\nOptimistic Nihilism is the name that is given to it nowadays, earlier it used to be called noble stoicism.\n\nThen I found that I was healing rather rapidly and got employed again and so now I had 2 things to do in life - do well at work without damaging myself through burnout and use the money and skills I earned to see and help someone, anyone, somehow, anyhow.\n\nThis gave me immense sense of purpose. When my little savings helped pay for a poor kid's school for 2 years, I suddenly had purpose and energy from it. When my little savings saved a puppy and a kitten from certain death, I already had a new family.\n\nFrom a loser in my own mind, I went to becoming a hero of sorts. It was much lower effort than trying to invent the next big software or next big portal, but I actually mattered to someone, someone who told me clearly that if not for me, their life would be miserable.\n\nThat's where the real big changes happened.\n\nNow I am rather more selfish and focus a lot on my work, living like a normal person, but I hold a deep respect and gratitude for nature and the cosmos in general, because compared to cold dark space, there is all this beauty and variety and purpose in life. I keep about 20% of savings for purely such activities.\n\nSince once you are known to have been mentally ill, nobody considers you attractive enough to get romantic with, I just completely broke off the whole relationship game and that freed me to actually experience true love - from animals and from kids that I played or taught or worked with.\n\nI also read a lot on Buddhism. It's an amazing belief system that everyone should try out for some time in life.\n\nNeedless to say the internet and Google have been a huge part of every aspect of this recuperation and that is why I am a fan of the internet and of Google. It might be a data greedy corporation, but it has answered almost all of my questions and saved my ass countless times in handling life issues, not just software (which is its daily service to the software industry :) )\n\nAnd all the great people who write stuff on the internet. First it was mailing lists, then chat support forums, then reddit.\n\nNever went to Myspace / Facebook / Twitter, thank heavens for that. Seemed too artificial right from the start and is now proved to be so every day. Being depressed at the time, I caught on the true nature of the social networks very early and stayed clear.\n\nI read a lot of quotes from famous people and I'm an introvert so I think a lot about what I read and link it to other things I feel and read. I love solitude except when helping others out. Solitude gives peace and time to recover from the onslaught of data and social interactions. \n\nAlso, programming forces you to clearly think about everything and does not leave room for logic errors. So it enables me to dismantle half-baked fears, beliefs, and also to fight panic and anxiety to quite an extent.\n\nGratitude for what you have is great for mental health, compassion for all living beings is great nourishment for the soul, it gives purpose and self-worth, and desire for knowledge gives you the ability to acquire skills and information to fight the disorder, whatever it may be.\n\nI also have a few close friends and family who support me without judging, but there was a time when there was nobody. Even then, the internet helped me out.\n\nAgain, because I have had no relationships for the past 20 years, I have had time to explore and improve. No real family responsibilities, no relationship headaches, no children of my own to consume my life, but quite a few animals and kids who are my friends, and a general feeling of having been of use to the planet. When I compare this with the traditional career, family, kids routine, I find this an equally satisfying way of living, actually more meaningful.\n\nWhat took me 1 year to learn now takes me 3 years, but I learn it well, organically, exploring all angles which might not be dealt with in a syllabus / course curriculum and I constantly look to apply analogies between unrelated fields. That makes me appear smart while not actually being so. However, such introspection is not frivolous when seen in the context of general purpose AI. So I feel pretty good about that too :)\n\nWhat remains now is the regular recurring chronic symptoms, which I manage with the combination of one or more of medicine, exercise, introspection, online chats, quotes, talks on health, psychology, etc. I also take up challenges to stretch my limits. So, for instance, I gave a small talk at a local event before 25 older people about how to use technology and scored some brownie points as well as proved to myself that I could handle an audience older than me (but completely clueless about tools I use daily). The downside is that I became the computer guy, but now I have social currency with \"established normal people\" that I can encash at any time.\n\nI keep doing such things, pushing my limits. I talk to cabbies and to fast food stall owners. A few times I talked to labourers at a factory site while they were on a break. These kinds of things have no downside and help boost my confidence.\n\nI also keep a diary of such activities, which I read several times, which gives me great comfort when I look back to where I started after the first panic attacks and depression.\n\nCould not afford formal therapy at the time, and as I now know, many of these are tools used or suggested by therapists, so I was right all along. Gives a great kick to have fixed myself, somewhat, with tons of help from Google and the kind people on the internet. As a species, we've made a lot of progress, with the internet, if you look past the stupid majority hooked onto social media.",

            "I thought that would be my solution too but it seems between the time I have a thought that I don't want to lose and how long it takes me to find something to write it down with and on top of, I've already forgotten it! So my solution to this was to get small dry erase boards (approximately 5\" x '7 sized ones) and put them in each room in my house,mandatory places would be the kitchen, bedroom and especially the bathroom! Seems to be where most of my light bulb moments occur, LOL.  I found a bunch of them at Office Max one year right around the beginning of the school year dirt cheap. They even came w/ a dry erase marker and have a magnetic strip in the back to mount them to the wall. It has helped a lot! They say (whoever \"they\" are) that the act of writing down something is much more likely to stick in your head than just trying to remember it or even typing it. Apps dont do it for me because it takes me too long to open it. You do need to go around to each room and compile those thoughts onto a master list at some point in time but  as long as they are there I'm good.",

Not saying weed is bad in general but it's bad for me.",

And now some shit in my life has me feeling anxious literally 24/7, panic attack blackouts nearly every time I drink..

Turns out I've been living with undiagnosed Tourettes on top of a bunch of other nonsense. Counseling has helped as well.

It also increases dopamine with the brain. Many people report having more stable energy and being much more productive when they drink green tea, compared with coffee.

It really levels me out (in addition to my meds). The combination of the two really works for myself. \n\nI do know though, that it is different for everyone.  Play around with different strains and types (ie. indica, sativa, hybrid).

And they just smelt well..... green is only way I can describe it. \nlucky one of the people I went with was a regular smoker of weed and regular tobacco so they knew how to mix and roll but we tried about 4 different kinds plus cookies and brownies.

It helps me more than all of the different pharmaceuticals I've tried with fewer side effects, but it does contribute to increased anxiety at times. I think there is definitely a degree of overuse (which I fear I am experiencing currently) and like with all other things moderation is key.\n\nI think a mistake that a lot of first timers make is doing too much at once. Anecdotal story, somewhat related: When my grandfather was still living, he was in chronic pain. He was on morphine patches for years (fell off a roof and broke his back when he was 29; wasn't paralyzed, but had dozens of surgeries and 50 years of pain before passing away in 2018) and finally got an Rx for medical marijuana. He lived in California which, as many of you know, was one of the first medicinal states. Anyway, he got his prescription filled and got some potent, high grade, medical marijuana delivered to his house along with what I think was a bong or water pipe (he didn't know the name, just described it), and proceeded to get *high as fuck*. (This is not surprising, considering he never followed his prescriptions. He often traded meds with his bodies and doubled up on his patches.) He hit it multiple times (I think the Rx was written for 1 -2 hits) and experienced what is colloquially known as a \"greening out,=\", which is basically a marijuana induced panic attack. (I have unintentionally done this in the past while trying to keep up with more seasoned stoners, specifically the first time I tried dabbing. 0/10, do no recommend.) So, if you do decide to give it a try, I would suggest looking into micro-dosing, which might be easier to do if you live some where with legal access and measured/documented dosing. Edibles could also be a good option for controlled dosing.\n\nAlso, be aware that there are different strains with different effects. I prefer indicas dominant strains. Sativas tend to trigger my anxiety more, while indicas are more mellow.",
            "It was a double edged sword at best for me. At this moment I'm better off completely without it, but at other times in my life, it did help. We probably won't damage ourselves or anything using weed, but It's about progress and trying to get to where we want to go. If it helps you do that, you probably don't need to address it right now. If is beginning to hinder you, quit for a month and allow yourself to get to know your uninfluenced thoughts. weed will still be around in a month.",

If I\u2019m upset it helps me relax and think about something else. \n\nI usually start my day with a few hits, do some stretching and do a hard workout. I\u2019ll take a few more before I do chores like wash dishes, or clean. \n\nYou have to push yourself to be in a good mindset though because I think it\u2019s easy to get stoned and continue to ruminate if you\u2019re in a very bad place. So I always look at it as I\u2019m going to smoke and move onto something I would like to do or give my attention to. \n\nFor some people it will help more than others, my tolerance is so high that I don\u2019t get super stoned and I\u2019m able to continue to do what I wanna do and it makes life and monotonous tasks more enjoyable to do. \n\nWhat really made the difference for me with depression and anxiety right now is adderall and I\u2019ve only been experimenting with it for a month but it has gotten me out of bed and I wake up every day wanting to be productive with my time. I still use weed daily. Before the adderall I would lay in bed and completely just disregard the uncleanliness of my home, ignore chores, ignore financial problems, and ignore myself and smoke weed to do the things I enjoyed like working out.

            "I do and it helps me immensely. You have to be selective which strains you use. Indicas are typically the best for anxiety. I smoke some about an hour before bed every night. It helps my brain calm down and helps me sleep. Otherwise my anxiety keeps me awake. I\u2019ve been tracking my anxiety for a few years now and just started smoking within the last year. I went from having about 12 panic attacks a month on average to less than 1 a month. And some months I don\u2019t even have one. It also helps with my other general anxiety symptoms. But it takes some trial and error to find a strain that works the best for you. Take it slow and remember that any negative effect you\u2019re experiencing will only last about an hour. And don\u2019t give up because you use one strain that didn\u2019t agree with you. There\u2019s hundreds of strains to choose from. And if you\u2019ve never smoked before, start out with the lowest recommended amount. If you\u2019re using edibles, start with 5mg. If you\u2019re smoking flower, start with only 1-2 hits. You also want to look specifically for strains with a higher CBD content. That helps reduce the psychoactive effects of THC that can actually cause anxiety and paranoia. Leafly.com (they have an app to) is a really good place to start researching possible strains.",

If I'm experiencing obsessive thoughts or worries where I just can't get my brain out of a spiral, smoking cannabis really helps. Note that you can't get cannabis that is just CBD, so if you want to avoid THC you need to buy CBD oil. Also be very careful if you're young, like younger than 25 not to smoke too much because substance induced psychosis is definitely a thing. The key is to pay attention to your individual reaction. I personally have never really had a bad experience with weed, but many people have, so start low and go slow, and do it with someone you trust and get it from a trusted source.",

I\u2019m 24, have been smoking for almost 9 years. \n\nI have social anxiety and when I\u2019m high around people I don\u2019t know well, my anxiety tends to be a lot worse. I tend to zone out and worry that I\u2019m coming off as rude or that people can tell I\u2019m anxious, making my anxiety worse. I tend to get very paranoid in social situations when high, especially if I\u2019m around people that don\u2019t smoke or approve of smoking. \n\nIf I\u2019m alone, having anxious thoughts or if I want to sleep- weed usually helps me. It also helps when I\u2019m angry and need to calm down. When I\u2019m depressed, I find that weed can help motivate me to do things such as clean or shower. That\u2019s if I really want to do those things, though. Otherwise I\u2019ll just get high and sleep or use my phone continuously for hours. \n\nAs I\u2019ve been smoking for quite a while, I can usually tell if weed is going to help at the time or make me feel worse.",

If I smoke when I am experiencing depression, it breaks me out of my negative thought loop and allows me to enjoy some other task for a while, which can be good. However, If I am feeling anxious and I smoke, due to my elevated heart rate and general awkwardness, I feel a large INCREASE in anxiety symptoms. Therefore, I do not smoke If i am planning on being out, and I also stick to Indicas as opposed to sativas because the latter seems to exacerbate negative side effects. \n\nThe beauty and the danger of weed is that it effects everyone differently. Try being sober for a week or two and then experiment with different strains and see what happens.",

Which isn't always good. However, (as much as it helped) for other reasons I cannot go back to it like before.

I thought eating some brownies, smoking it and taking shots would get me out of this funk. \n\nNope. I remember how I noticed my depression was right there while my mind and body was somewhere else. \n\nI hear shrooms is the best way to go with trying to help you with anxiety and depression. I've never tried it so I can't comment on it. But weed, for me, is like alcohol. You do it to relax yourself and distract your mind temporarily. That's it.",

The only way it\u2019s helped me with my anxiety is that I used to get hella paranoid when I\u2019m high but started to realize that the shit that I worry about is irrational.

I've gone through some stages in life where it's been more frequent use, but honestly I'm mostly an occasional user overall. I'd say it all comes down to what works best for you and your brain and body. For example, I can't smoke sativa strains, honestly. They spike my anxiety and make me really antsy. I stick with indicas and also CBD/THC combos. I've found what works best are combo tinctures and flower where there's a higher ratio of CBD to THC. Or I find pre-roll joints where the THC content is a little less intense. Granted, I'm in CA so I have a massive amount of options at my disposal, I'm not sure where you're located.\n\n3:1 CBD/THC tinctures and flower combos help me A LOT with anxiety. They produce a more mellow high, and you get the calming effects of CBD. That honestly has been the best development for me over the years in terms of what works to calm my anxiety. Do note that with hybrid CBD/THC stuff that the high will get MORE intense the close the ratio is. I would stay away from 1:1 CBD/THC unless you really want to go to the moon.

In my experience, completely relying on any one thing, be it a substance or a practice or prescription or therapy or whatever seems to always go poorly for me. I end up fixating on that \"one thing\" that makes me feel better and end up overusing it until I freak out about it not working as well anymore.

            "The recommended psychiatric dosage is between 7.5mg and 12.5mg. Average gram of weed is 20% THC, 200mg total. Most people smoke far more than necessary and end up with more depression, paranoia, and anxiety. The difference is at a low dose, you activate just the amygdala, which gives you a sense of arousal, and the extra processing is reigned in by your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Basically they tell your amygdala that there\u2019s no real threat and you\u2019re just high. Once you dose too high, your hippocampus and PFC start to excite similarly to the amygdala. Now you have no control over that arousal, your emotional center and planning ability start to fail, and without these parts of the brain working properly, that chemically induced sense of arousal is interpreted as actual fear",

            "Here's my take so far after smoking daily for a little over a year. I started Lexapro from about November 2018 to February 2020, and I'm now on Zoloft.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- It's the only thing that gets me to sleep through the night. My psychiatrist recently tried to get me on trazodone. I tried 25mg of it one night and that actually \\*woke me up\\* so I had to use weed right after it. (I checked online to make sure this wouldn't kill me.)\n\n\\- Do your absolute fucking best to not use it daily. If you have any type of PTSD, history of binging, or food insufficiency issues (which lead to binging of other things), keep your supply very limited. Maybe only smoke with a friend who keeps it at their place or give it to a trusted roommate for safe-keeping. I much prefer this method because I don't feel the need to constantly up my dose or smoke whenever.\n\n\\- Supplement or mix THC with CBD/CBG if you're extra craving it. You're probably craving the ritual of smoking/vaping, not THC itself. I recommend Berkshire CBD products and so does /r/CBD or /r/hemp.\n\n\\- Keep a schedule going where you block out weed usage. If you're working, that's a perfect blocking out of several hours. If you're going to smoke, I recommend doing it at night when responsibilities are low and you're probably going to bed within a couple of hours. I aim to smoke after 9 PM. I won't lie and say I'm not craving it right now because I finished all of my major responsibilities for the day.\n\n\\- If you do become dependent, you CAN make it through the 'withdrawals.' I became irritable as fuck and couldn't sleep for more than 3 hours, but it was also at the beginning of the shutdowns and all of my roommates being in one house together at the same time (all the time) has put extra stress on me. I went a month without weed before giving back in purely because I needed to sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- For equipment, I strongly recommend the PAX 3. Right now, everyone needs to keep their lungs healthy in case of infection. PAX 3 feels like you're inhaling tea vapor. Even on its highest settings with deep pulls, I only cough a little if at all. Weed lasts much longer with this, especially while using the half full topper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Big important note: you might get tachycardia (increased HR) from smoking. This is a mostly natural reaction. If you are taking beta blockers, this might lessen the effects of the BB and cause tachycardia no matter what. This passes for me within 15 minutes. Just stay hydrated.\n\nAlso, I believe everyone with anxiety should look into dysautonomia, especially the POTS subtype. It explained a lot of my physical symptoms.",
            "Hmmm well for me I\u2019ve always been an on and off smoker then about 5-6 years ago I went into a serious depressive / anxious phase which was fuelled by a serious health anxiety issue I couldn\u2019t even sneeze without thinking something absolutely horrifying was happening to me I was a wreck and during that I didn\u2019t smoke so I ended up losing my job due to my anxiety and stayed in bed for three weeks smoking ridiculous amounts and it helped it helped ease all anxieties and worries I actually left the house , started going gym etc ... but I smoked all the time like all the time and it did help but about 8 months ago something awful happened in my life and every time I would even have two puffs of a joint my heart would start racing , panic attacks would happen so I obviously had to quit and once I got over the 3 weeks of sweating so much at night I had to buy a new mattress (btw be prepared by matter protectors etc if your gonna quit) I felt more confident and outgoing than I did when I was smoking it all the time but saying that it helped me massively through a serious depressive stage of my life I don\u2019t think i would of got through it without weed but it was only a short term option . But now I smoke again but now I\u2019ve got my head clear I enjoy smoking and it\u2019s not stunting me as I\u2019ve gone back to it once I got a grip of my mental health and I\u2019m in a good place ... so it all depends if you use it to help with your problem or just use it to mask your problem if that makes sense xxx anyway sending you well wishes in whatever your facing now and everything works out in the end x PS sorry for spelling mistakes etc on phone and the screen slightly cracked my friends x",

            "I have been smoking every day for two months now, and I know it helps. Before I smoked my anxiety levels were off the charts. Whether it was work, personal or stress I would constantly worry till the point of nauseam. I had trouble eating, but pot has changed my life drastically. I no longer take my anxiety meds, and I'm the happiest I've ever been. Coming home from working a long day, getting high and cooking and listening to music is the best thing ever. This is just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. Everyone should try it at least once! Carpe diem right?",

In the beginning it was a miracle remedy for me, but as time went on it worsened my anxiety and i\u2019m pretty sure i have had bouts of psychosis due to marijuana usage (when i was using everyday) i think it can help if it\u2019s not severe anxiety or depression that you\u2019re dealing with. Marijuana is not always benefitting. That\u2019s just my experience though.  I know everyone is different. just be careful ~",

I found that most of the time it helped when I was only doing it on weekends instead of doing it every single day. I would say give it a try and see how it works. Just be sure to do it in moderation because contrary to popular belief, it can for sure be mentally addictive as it is really nice to get high.",

I use to get panic and anxiety attacks but when I started smoking I had little to none, however, recently I have stopped almost completely. I found myself getting more paranoid and felt I was wasting away just getting stoned and watching tv. Now that I have stopped my anxiety attacks are back worse than ever. I definitely think it can help in a controlled way. I do not recommend in my personal experience facing blunts all day everyday to cope. Now I\u2019m looking for better ways to get get out of my rut but I will bring it back into my routine when I feel I have more control over it.",
            "It depends on a number of factors - strain, THC content, your general headspace. I find that smoking low THC % indica with my friends calms my nerves. Smoking stronger flower/any hybrids make me super anxious for days. It\u2019s about finding a balance that works for you!",
            "Indicia is excellent for stress relief.\n\nHowever, try to keep it to low THC levels of 10-15% max. For most, it helps them to relax.\n\nOthers like myself experience increase in anxiety due to THC sensitivity.\n\nYou'll want high CBD (10%+) and very low THC (5% or lower) in such case",

            "I find high THC strains contribute to anxiety pretty badly for me, ven to the point of panic attacks (even in the short term) whereas if I keep THC low and get some with maybe higher CBD then I'm generally alright. I've heard that THC can actually exacerbate anxiety but CBD can do wonders in calming it down, so perhaps that is why. I am a very irregular user, no more than 7 days out of the month MAX (usually more like 3-4) so YMMV, but part of the reason I am so irregular is because personally, I found when I started to make it a more regular habit my mental health decreased and anxiety increased pretty significantly. When I keep it to an irregular thing I do no more than once or twice a week, I find it doesn't negatively affect me so long as I'm mindful of the strains I use.",

            "If it was legal where I lived, I would totally take the good stuff that would help with anxiety. But right now I take what I can get. Personally, smoking actually worsens my anxiety. I'm always worried about if people in my building can smell it; if I see someone walk outside my apt I think that they can smell it and will call the cops on me. I sometimes even get uncomfortable around my boyfriend whom I live with. \n\nI think it really depends on the strain and the situation. It definitely helps a lot of people! I look forward to the day that I either live somewhere where it is legal or it becomes legal where I live so it can hopefully help",
            "I used to and it honestly would help, but im laying off due to the pandemic. Because of the pandemic ive been starting to get angry and paranoid (not anxious) when i smoke i can get very emotional, past shit would haunt me as well. My doctor who I've had for years and knows my entire background oppresses me from using it. Which i understand. It's safer to use it socially with friends, but it has pissed me off now the pandemic has given it negative effects, where prior it was everything to me. My sister recommends to wait a year, so only time will tell. Also alcholol has had worse feelings and i plan on giving that up permanently.",

            "We truly aren't certain if it helps or if it can actually make things worse.  We have little to no clinical evidence.  As such it can't conclusively be prescribed as treatment.  We'll need at least a decade of trials after scientific study becomes legal before it can be decisively prescribed- or not.\n\nAs it stands, anti anxiety medications taken for extended periods of time coupled with therapy works for most people, and no psychiatrist will be recommending marijuana unless they've exhausted other options.  It's psychoactive, and can have lasting negative effects that far outweigh the temporary positives.",

            "To me was very helpful! It helped me with imsonia and appetite. Anyway when I started to feel better it has been difficult to stop. Now I smoke from time to time just for the fun! Also I prefer sativa to indica or hash... Hashish and indica can make me paranoid, but maybe is just personal",
            "Not me.  No sir.  Definitely not.\n\nIf I DID, though, I'd say maybe.  Depends on the strain of marijuana.\n\nWhat i have problems with is my mind refusing to be quiet.  My thoughts scream at me constantly, reminding me of past events that were embarrassing or traumatising and generally making me depressed and suicidal.\n\nIt numbs your brain, quiets those voices, and makes everything foggy and mellow.\n\nOf course there's always the possibility of getting your hands on something that does the exact opposite.  Some strains will heighten your paranoia and anxiety and just jack your brain from you.  Your friends will find you hiding under the sheets in the corner of your bedroom, shaking and waiting for the end of the goddamn world.\n\nHard to say what it'll do to you.  If you're really interested you may consider consulting a professional.  i don't know if you live in a state with dispensaries, but the folks that work there are usually pretty knowledgeable about which types are good for which issues.",
            "I started smoking weed so I could stop going for 0 to 100 all the time because I\u2019m always stressed and have a short fuse and I was sick of taking it out on the people I love. It works well for that but if I\u2019m already panicky it makes it worse so yeah",

Just saying they absolutely helped me and are worth a try. If you don\u2019t want to \u201close control\u201d I\u2019d suggest micro dosing every third day for two weeks.",

For me it relaxes me completely wether it\u2019s sativa or indica or hybrid it just slows me down completely and I currently use it to sleep.\n\nOn the other hand, my bf can\u2019t use it or be near the smoke because he\u2019s too sensitive and it triggers his anxiety and gives him panic attacks.\n\nI have friends who get more hyped and even use it to work, I can\u2019t because I fall asleep mid trip.",

            "I have also recently given up after 10+ years of smoking. As much as the plant is great for short term relief, it is not helpful in my opinion in the long term. If anything it makes it so much worse. Now Im also in such a better place. I'm calm, happy not irritable. Giving up weed was the best thing I could do. I still smoke from time to time but only as a social activity. Not to self medicate. \n\nIf anyone has anxiety and are looking into the route of smoking, please speak to a Dr about therapy or long term medication. Obviously everyone is different... Just don't  go down the rabbit hole of treating it with smoking. You might find it could be what is actually causing your anxiety.\n\nCBD is great for calming but the THC side of weed can really heighten any feelings of anxiety.\n\nSorry to jump on your comment. I just whole heartedly agree with you.",

A low-dose THC/CBD blend has worked for actual anxiety help. I can still work and get shit done and not feel like a lazy piece of shit. \n\nIf I get high I immediately get anxious because I know I\u2019m going to neglect things I should be doing and that will automatically make me feel like a paranoid failure at life. So fun!",
            "Same for me. It totally depends on what state of mind I'm in BEFORE i start smoking. If things are bothering me then it tends to make my anxiety about those things worse. But if I'm happy, it tends to make me even more happy... if that makes sense.",

Vibryd side effects were worse, and some that I experienced weren\u2019t even listed on their website(if curious look up \u201cbrain zaps viibryd.\u201d)When anxiety and depression aren\u2019t kicking my butt I\u2019m generally a happy person. So through therapy I\u2019ve learned how to deal with the anxiety. It still happens, but I do things to prevent it, and when I\u2019m in it I\u2019ve learned tools to get out of it. I know this path isn\u2019t for everyone, and it\u2019s not exactly perfect for me. Like I said I\u2019ve had to use weed to balance it out a little. I never compare suffering, my anxiety is different than yours, and all the other things that come with it. But that fear you\u2019re talking about is real. I get it. I would recommend talking to a therapist. Here\u2019s the rub. If you go through insurances the therapist will most likely just teach you tools to cope with your issues, rather than cognitive talk therapy that generally gets to the root of the issue, as the pay out of pocket folks do. Which is much more expensive. This has been my experience, and I\u2019ve heard it from therapists, and therapees alike. Hope this helps! Stay safe, friend! Always welcome to PM if you want to chat more about it.",
            "I agree with this. It affects everyone differently. I am super fortunate to NEVER have increased anxiety after smoking (but I have considered that smoking regularly maybe makes my anxiety worse when I\u2019m not high.) It works better than any prescribed medication, and I\u2019m on 8. My boyfriend always gets a 20 min intense anxiety period after smoking, followed by relaxation. Some people get insanely paranoid, with no relaxation. Only you know what\u2019s best for you!",

            "Thank you! I greatly appreciate your answer :) I started therapy really early on (9 years old) and unfortunately it didn't help with my anxiety until I got on medications. It only helped a little but not to  function in life without my extreme anxiety getting in the way. I luckily got weened off Klonopin about a year ago which is a huge accomplishment. But now my anxiety is higher than ever, so I'm going to first try the route of CBD oil. Lexapro helps a bit but I feel hyped up all the time on it. Thank you again for your input \ud83d\ude0a",
            "It\u2019s been like that since I was a kid. Dying in dreams, being chased, all that. Got a stark reminder about them during my t break. They\u2019re vivid, but not great. Stay safe, friend!",
            "I understand the struggle! Unfortunately it\u2019s like a guess and test situation, but at least you\u2019re aware of what\u2019s going on and wanting to work on it.",
            "I know the childhood dreams never left. I used to dream of falling off a cliff or getting in car accident and waking up covered in sweat and panting with adrenaline. Luckily as of late, it\u2019s been ok."

            "Hey Hensot\n\nAre you on any medication for anxiety or depression? I find that I usually get those side effects when I take certain medications. I'm f32 and have been on many. 3 nervous breakdowns and anxiety had caused a lot of brain fog,  forgetfulness, and plain old brain farts all day, and I have had to make adjustments to my everyday lifestyle to accommodate.\n\nI find it helpful to write stuff down and have an accountability person who can help me keep my appointments or engagements in order and scheduled. \n\nSome people do just have horrible memories. Some people i know are so forgetful, but their outside appearance tells me they don't really care and they roll with it. Maybe they're faking it, but hell,  what a way to live. \n\nPerhaps counseling, therapy, and doctor visits are in order, if those things are accessible where you live. I don't know how old you are or if you have experience with family members who have or had alzhiemers or dementia, but it is a real fear even I have after caring for my MIL for a year it's a horrible disease that should scare anyone. But do take steps to mitigate your worries through the avenues listed above. Do some research for your age group, race, lifestyle, etc.. But DO NOT become completely absorbed. A lot of OCD sufferers I know delved too deep into health worries, and it is very difficult for them to resurface unscathed. \n\nTherapy in a Nutshell is an excellent youtube channel dedicated to anxiety help. But I'd very much push you to seek doctor help and perhaps ask for some medication intervention in the meantime. I am on Zoloft, personally, for my crippling anxiety and  new found OCD brain tendencies as my psychiatrist worded it. It's a difficult medication for the first couple of weeks, but it has helped me overcome some of my health anxiety and thinking patterns that lead me to worry so much. \n\nI hope you can find some form of help soon. It's ahard but you can do it.",
            "I'm on Cipralex. I went to a doctor for not so long ago, to express my concerns like dementia. He was certain I didn't have dementia, but he did not have a clear answer on my symtoms. I'm still not convinced that I don't have alzheimer/dementia, mostly due to lack of clarity about my issues. I have talked to my psychologist, who's been a nurse. She also believes I don't have a dementia. However, It's so terrifying to experience these symptoms. I can't think of any other cause than a serious disease.",
            "I totally feel you. It is scary. The disease is horrible, and the fear of having it is terrible, too. Do you have any alzhiemer outlets near you? I'm in Ontario, Canada, and there are a few in major towns that have centers for people seeking help for loved ones etc. you can speak with people about and get cognition tests there. \n\nHealth anxiety really is horrible. The more you research, the worse it can get for you. The uncertainty you feel when researching is quelled when you find info, and then it feeds into your uncertainty more and more. Perhaps ask your doctor for a referral to a therapist or a cbt group? It has been helpful for me with my own gastro problem health anxieties, too. It may be helpful for you. Good luck, Hensot"

            "I feel exactly the same. Often it even makes my depression and anxiety even worse, because I feel so guilty for being this way without a good enough reason. Especially when someone says \"but your life isn't so bad?\" As if I don't know that. Also, I worry about the fact that I already cannot handle life as it is now, so it could get a lot worse if bad things happen.",
            "I can really relate to this. But we shouldn't treat mental illness like that. A lot of us can't trace back our issues to specific events in our lifes. Actually a lot of mental illnesses are also genetically inherited. In my case it's my ADHD. And anxiety is a very usual thing to develope for people with ADHD, so it makes a lot of sense actually. Maybe talk to a cognitive behaviour therapist about it. Please stop feeling guilty for feeling the way you feel. There's no award for having the worst childhood, that makes you \"earn\" mental issues haha\ud83e\udd2d\n\nI actually had a depth psychologist for some years, who always tried to trace back my issues to some underlying family dynamics in my life, but there just isn't anything worth discussing.\nI developed my anxiety, because of my behaviour. In my case it started with not to going to school, to avoid confrontation with my teachers, when I didn't have my homework, because of my ADHD. And when you start going down these routes, it can get worse and worse and the things you avoid become scarier and scarier. That's just how our mind works. And the good news is, that anxiety is actually really treatable, because of that. Just find yourself the right therapist, that sees anxiety for what it is and start breaking down your behaviour and thought patterns together.",

            "You don\u2019t have to be traumatized to have anxiety.  For some reason, you have it.  You\u2019ve earned it by being human, which I think is more shit luck than linking specific moments that created something.  Not sure how much anxiety is a nature vs nurture thing, but don\u2019t feel the need to beat yourself up even more than the anxiety already is by telling yourself you have no reason to feel this way.",
            "That\u2019s the thing - anxiety and depression are not logical.  Sure, bad experiences can trigger them and make worse, but in the end it\u2019s a chemical imbalance in the brain.  It\u2019s a physical/ medical condition",

I should be grateful when so many people do not have all or even one of these. But I grew up in a home where my parents fought a lot, I\u2019ve never really had long term friends or romantic relationships, and I have a very difficult relationship with my brother well actually more like we don\u2019t have one but he\u2019s always present because he has severe mental issues.

            "Any anxiety is valid, whether you had a good upbringing or not. I think you are concerned about it, go to your doctor and get his advice. I'm also sure that you're not alone on this",
            "Mental illness doesn\u2019t discriminate, doesn\u2019t matter how hard you life was or wasn\u2019t, I do understand how you feel though but just because someone may have it worse it doesn\u2019t cancel out your own feelings and experiences",

It\u2019s an illness that can affect anyone and show up at any time. The idea that you have to \u201cearn\u201d any mental illness is part of the same kind of thinking that pretends mental illness isn\u2019t that serious, isn\u2019t really a problem, and is probably fake anyway. Sound familiar? I\u2019ve heard shit like this from people all my life and I spent most of my adult life feeling like a weak piece of garbage because I couldn\u2019t always suck it up and be tough. I\u2019m so glad I started listening to smarter people! \n\nTLDR: You didn\u2019t earn an illness, that\u2019s not how any of it works.",
            "I felt this way when I decided to seek out some help. I then talked to a therapist and quickly realized that what I thought was a normal upbringing and uneventful life was definitely not. So many little things that I didn't relate to my anxiety. However from a standpoint of hearing others stories, I tend to play the well they have it much worse so I'm okay card quite often. (Not a good approach and something I'm working on but nonetheless!)",
            "I don't have a similar background, but I do think that we all have different triggers and sometimes they arise from unexpected places. Even if you had a great childhood, you can still encounter a perfect storm of events that push just the right buttons, causing you to unravel.",
            "That\u2019s not how anxiety and depression works. Some people who go through intense situations or bad childhoods don\u2019t automatically have depression or anxiety.  Having a good childhood or even being rich doesn\u2019t protect you from depression or anxiety.",

My psych told me look, I don\u2019t care how much your parents loved you and how good they were - they still traumatized you in these ways. I grew up in a time where mental health was seen as a moral failing somehow and things like anxiety were considered  lack of trust in God. It  sucks but my anxiety and trauma is valid and so is yours. Don\u2019t be me and have to deal with 30 years of self doubt. I wish you well and I HEAR you and SEE you.",
            "You don't need to earn anxiety or depression to suffer from it, friend \u2764\ufe0fon the other hand you don't deserve it either",
            "For a long time I was in denial about even having anxiety/depression because I didn't think I \"earned\" it either. It made me feel guilty for having those feelings because I had such a good childhood and upbringing etc. So yeah I can relate. BUT I've since learned that I have a lot more trauma than I thought I did. I really hated using that word because I always thought trauma had to be some kind of horrifically significant event but trauma comes in many, many forms and even subtle things will stick in our brains and stack up over time. Even things that we in our thinking minds try to rationalize as \"not that bad\" or that we consider insignificant will play major roles in the way our brains operate and kick into survival mode in the form of anxiety. I took a good long look at my life and the things that trigger my anxiety and put a lot of pieces together that I didn't acknowledge before and I understand my anxiety a lot more now. \n\nWe can also have great childhoods but again, subtle things we may not have ever thought about will be forever imprinted in our brains. Everyone's anxiety/depression is VALID. It should never be a competition of who had it worse or who has a \"better\" reason to be anxious or depressed. The mindset you're having and that I had for a long time is self sabotaging and adds a weird guilt dynamic to the way we see our mental illness. Don't let anyone else's stories make yours feel invalid or not as important.",
            "this is a poor way of thinking that was made by people who think anxiety issues come from some spectacularly horrible event in ones life. Be it born from trauma or festering thoughts throughout years its all an illness and not to be downplayed\n\ni used to be the same way becuase, like you said, i dont have many big events i can point at and go \"that fucked me up\" but i know my problems and that i need to work on them",

            "Anxiety and depression often have little to do with outside circumstances. \n\nIt is enough that you have this suffering to manage, without adding to it by devolving into a self worth exercise about whether you have 'earned' it or not. \n\nYou own it. It is yours to manage, and that is enough already. \n\nLove yourself. Your body is talking to you. Listen to it and look for the source elsewhere. \n\nHint: We've traced the call to your head. Your anxiety is calling from inside your head. Get out of your head... by focusing on the sensations in your body. They are just sensations, and then we get going looking for reasons for them... Relax, breathe, and go toward them. Breathe oxygen into them. They are you -- love them they are your own pain and want to let go. \n\nRunning away or resisting them makes them worse. \n\nParadox I know but try it. You won't die. It might help. Good luck.",
            "Felt like that, but in counselling realized how much I really had been through compared to an average person. I just didn't have that one extreme thing that would have made it obvious from the start, but most areas in my life sucked and it got normalized to the point I was very out of touch with what average even is. Like the opposite of being spoiled is how it was described to me, all these challenges and just thinking its what everyone deals with. If I write out stuff about my life now its almost hilarious to look back on cause its so obviously rough and if anything I thought I had it easy.\n\n Of course the people I was mostly around like my friends, many of them were some extreme cases of difficult upbringings, so I was comparing my life to the worst of the worst. Not realizing I was still closer to them than to an average person. Or what I'd assume to be an average person, let's just say a decently well balanced person. \n\nLike I had an ex whose dad died in her childhood from drugs and he was a gang leader type guy, her mom was a crack addict so she got raised by a family member who sold drugs out of the house and had prostitutes using the house and sleeping there. I had a friend whose single mom was a prostitute so he had to get raised by his extremely religious, borderline cultist grandma. There's much worse stuff that people i knew went through that I don't even want to type out, thats the kind of stuff I was comparing myself to. \n\nDidn't really have many normal people around, or role models to explain how extreme all this stuff was. In fact I felt guilty for having it good, however my family always struggled and we were poor, there are a lot of untreated mental problems/conditions among my family members that had really damaging effects on me. We didn't talk about anything like this so I grew to only blame myself or constantly be looking for ways I can help fix the situation even though a kid should never have to take on burdens like that. \n\nThat can start a really bad habit of internalizing and self blame for stuff out of your control, which can take years to reprogram your thinking into a healthy way. I got beat up many times as a kid and even got bullied, and I am ashamed to say the only way I learned to prevent that kind of stuff was to become a bully myself once I was a little bit older than that. My school sucked and too many kids were from the hood or in gangs and stuff like that, wish I had been in a better place. Or at least found a better crowd to hang out with but I had some real self esteem problems and feelings of worthlessness, very low emotional intelligence so most of the people id connect with were the ones who also had problems in their lives \n\nHad a pretty bad life so far to be honest but I've made so much progress and starting to really feel better about the future. And at least its in perspective that I can accept it has been bad, that actually empowers me to identify problems and make changes. And those changes have been adding up, and it feels like I'm getting closer to a tipping point where I can finally say for once that my life is actually good overall",
            "Nah divorce can still be traumatizing.pandemic was bad. You don't need to have experienced every Ace in childhood to deserve a mental health condition. Take it from someone who was born into a good situation then got f by life several times over and still feels guilty for living.",

Instead it quells the anxiety to varying levels, often with the sensitive limbic system taking time to \"wind down.\" \n\nThe lack of satisfaction leaves the rational part of your brain feeling like the task was worthless, and causes depression from the seeming meaninglessness of completing tasks.\n\nOn the other hand if the task isn't completed, the depression comes from feeling worthless and incapable, often even manifesting itself as anger towards the self, fueling more anxiety on top.",

            "I had this same exact fear with my heart.\n\nI constantly thought I was going to have a heart attack.  I couldn't get out of bed in the morning without thinking I was going to die.  It all stemmed from overexerting myself at the gym one day and getting rhabdomyolysis (muscular breakdown essentially). I ended up being admitted to the hospital for two nights till my vitals normalized.  This event caused me to constantly think I was going to have a heart attack, or that something in general was wrong with my heart.  I was screaming in the ER/hospital that my heart was hurting and that I needed help, even though tests showed I was completely fine.  I even readmitted myself twice after I was discharged since I was convinced I wasn't okay, both times I came back with remarkable test results.  It was truly a horrible experience that ended with me on Xanax to calm my nerves.\n\nIn the weeks following this, after taking numerous MRIs, EKGs, stress tests, echocardiograms, angiograms, etc. to ensure I was truly healthy, my doctor determined I was dealing with severe anxiety that needed to be treated.  We chose to start Sertraline and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).  The first few weeks of starting/raising my dose and beginning therapy were still rough.  I had little hope that either was doing anything.  I specifically remember thinking to myself, \"This is going to be the rest of my life, living in fear that I'm an unhealthy, anxious man who's going to give myself a heart attack.  This is what my life has come to\".\n\nBut then, and I'll never forget it, I woke up and felt... okay for once.  The fear of having a heart attack wasn't conquering my mind.  I could get up and do things I couldn't do before like go out for a walk, hangout with friends, and watch TV.  I remember one day specifically thinking \"I'm a young, healthy 25-year-old man who just got tested with every test imaginable to ensure I'm a healthy person and they came back remarkable, Why should I be worried about this?\".  That was 3 years ago, and my life has truly turned around for the better after that point.  Being open to my doctor's suggestions changed my life and I'm so grateful I decided to listen.  I don't know where I'd be if I chose not to listen to my doctors, all's I know is I did and I'm better then I ever would've thought when I was going through this.\n\nAll in all, I think you should be open to what you're doctor is suggesting.

            "Anxiety isn\u2019t usually a serotonin issue and ssris can cause a lot of shitty and scary side effects, I had horrible ones and even panic attacks before I even knew what those were. Doctors also hand them out like candy with no warning or without trying other things to actually fix the problem first because well, it\u2019s a business after all, $. They\u2019re useful for depression and other more serious mental illnesses though. I wouldn\u2019t ever take them again even though now my anxiety is way worse than it was back then. I developed panic disorder years later and wonder if that ssri helped that along because before then I didn\u2019t even know what panic like *that* felt like, my brain would go back to that place easily it felt like it opened a door or something. Magnesium (glycinate or taurate) and exercise helps me these days. I pulled myself out of a horrible, horrible place I was having panic attacks all day everyday and now I very rarely have them and did it on my own, our bodies make the anxiety we can unlearn it, too. It\u2019s not a non fixable issue to be bandaided up, have to actually find the root and help it, which is so so so doable. Lots of natural ways to do that.

It helped tone down my nervous system enough to be able to resign myself mentally to whatever happens in life happens. It allowed me to feel more in control of my physical reaction.

            "i have anxiety and depression. i am on zoloft and a mood stabilizer. when we make adjustments to my doses of each, i find that the mood stabilizer seems to have a bigger impact on my depression and the zoloft seems to have a bigger impact on my anxiety. so zoloft could certainly help you get the anxiety under control. but everyone\u2019s brain chemistry is different so it\u2019s hard to say.",
            "Wow, I have exactly what you describe. The doctor put me on sertaline and it made everything worse the first week and then he gave me clonazepam to make me relax. Thats what worked, the clonazepam. But unfortunately you shouldn't take that every day. I got off the sertaline and have like 30 clonazepam pills left and that alone helps me. I don't take them but I understand this is just a panic attack and it's 100% this cardiophobia thing. If I could go back, I would never have gotten on the zoloft. My doctor did not listen to me at all.",
            "I take an SSRI and it has helped a lot with OCD symptoms. SSRIs are used to treat OCD pretty commonly, and it does kinda sound like you struggle with obsessive thoughts about your heart. \n\nFor me, I don\u2019t get stuck on the same thought loops for as long anymore. Or I\u2019m more able to reason with my brain. For example, I worry about my cats a lot when I\u2019m away from my house. Previously, I\u2019ve had several occasions where I\u2019ve either left work early, left in the middle of a shift and came back, or straight up called out of work and didn\u2019t even leave my home at all because I was so worried something would happen to them.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened to me in quite some time. I still worry about them, but it doesn\u2019t take over my whole day anymore.",

The propranolol significantly stops the physical symptoms.",
            "I was on Zoloft for two years from 25-100mg It helped with anxiety big time, depression not so much because it was rooted somewhere else.\n\nThe majority of my prescription was 50mg\n\nI would recommend it for sure, just make sure you do your work in finding what your triggers are and where your depression stems from, I was having panic attacks prior to the medication as well. If it doesn\u2019t work for you there\u2019s tons more, my ex tried two other ones before finding one that helped and none of them were Zoloft. My best friend was on it for 5 years before he tapered off and he\u2019s all good now.",

            "Certain SSRIs are also be indicated for certain anxiety disorders, Zoloft is one of them that is used for OCD and Panic Disorder. SSRIs are usually a first line option for providers for depression and anxiety due to their low abuse potential, lower side effect potential than other antidepressants, and the fact that they have lower toxic effects in the event of an overdose related to some other classes of psych meds. I work as a psych nurse and have seen hundreds of people begin SSRIs with little to no side effects to begin with. There are people that do experience negative side effects, but it is generally well handled. Personally I am prescribed 300 mg daily for OCD, with the option from my psych to up to 400, and have only really had major issues with libido (and only at higher levels). I would say to be aware that you can probably expect to be on a higher dose (150-200) before you would begin to experience relief from your anxiety.",

            "Yes Zoloft is used for anxiety as I am not depressed either.  I find it works great and as with any medication there\u2019s always side effects.  The worst for me upset stomach.  I also had some fluid retention so my doctors are keeping a close eye on that by doing various blood panels but this is supposedly rare and your more at risk if you are over age 60.  I started out on 1/2 of a 25 mg, and have worked my way up to about a 37.  50 is said to be the therapeutic dose but I have had such great relief from my anxiety that I am pleased at where I am at.  It is important to keep your doctor in the loop so they know about when you will need a refill as it\u2019s not recommended that you suddenly stop taking this medication.  There\u2019s a R/Zoloft group on Reddit that you may want to post to for other people\u2019s experience with Zoloft.  Best wishes to being on your way to a better life.

I\u2019m taking Tranxene for anxiety and it\u2019s the best! I use to take 7mg now I\u2019m down to 3.5 but technically I\u2019m down to even half of that because I only take a half of the 3.5 every day and I barely deal with anxiety anymore. I\u2019m not addicted to it either. So much so I\u2019ve actually thought about coming off it since I\u2019ve learned natural ways like the 54321 method and the cold pack on your face method and some others that I feel at this point could help me cope without medicine.

I\u2019m an active participant in my life again instead of just \u201cgetting thru\u201d moments and days.

I do, however, have depression as well, which is all the more reason to take it. \n\nI did try monotherapy with Buspirone (Buspar), which is often given with an SSRI as an adjunct therapy for anxiety. It has a really mild side effect profile for most people - however, I was taking a super low dose, yet was experiencing extreme lightheadedness and dizziness, to the point where I couldn\u2019t work for 2 hours after taking it. \n\nAll this to say - unfortunately, it\u2019s a highly individualized journey with a lot of trial and error.

            "I don\u2019t have experience with  Zoloft personally, but it\u2019s an ssri, and this class of drugs is used to treat both anxiety and depression. \n\nI took the ssri Paxil (paroxetine) for depression as a teenager and it worked very well. \n\nwhen I went to the clinic in college with anxiety (my words at the time were \u2018I\u2019m really stressed\u2019) they decided it must be depression and put me back on it. It did not help at all, (and the whole anxiety thing got lost in the shuffle when they kept upping my dose instead of listening to me when I\u2019d say it wasn\u2019t working, so pro tip, self-advocacy and ask questions until *you* don\u2019t have questions). \n\nPaxil is used to treat both depression and anxiety, and for some people it works well as an anti anxiety medication. It just wasn\u2019t a good one for me. It was stellar for my depression, though. Against expectations, so it wasn\u2019t a placebo effect, I could tell I felt better two days after I started taking it. Not like cured or anything, but better than before. \n\nSeveral years later my anxiety developed a panic disorder, and I eventually got put on the ssri cipralex (escitalopram), and, and this is also unusually quick action, I did not have a panic attack again after my first pill. We had to play with the dose to manage my general anxiety as well, so it wasn\u2019t an instant fix, but it very much worked. \n\nEscitalopram is used to treat depression and anxiety. Haven\u2019t tried it for depression, but it did wonders for my anxiety. \n\nI now also take a low dose of welbutrin (bupropion), which is a\u2026ndri? norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, for unspecified postpartum mood disorder. Which basically means I don\u2019t know if it was depression or anxiety or what, but something was up so we went ahead and treated it before it got worse. Welbutrin is also used to treat anxiety, as well as depression. \n\nBasically, a lot of drugs do both, and it is not weird to be prescribed an antidepressant for anxiety, because it is also an anti anxiety medication. And different bodies are different, so you might luck out and find the first med you try works great, or you might have to try more than one to find the one that works best for you. So if Zoloft ends up not working out, that isn\u2019t a sign that no ssri will work. \n\nSsris are all in the same family, but our family members aren\u2019t interchangeable, even though they\u2019re all related, and neither are drugs. \n\nThere are some people who find that no ssri really works for them,  but that\u2019s not super common, and it\u2019s also something you find out by trying multiple ssris. \n\n\nOh, and I honestly don\u2019t remember any side effects when I started taking Paxil or cipralex, but both were a while ago, and all that means is that there was nothing actively traumatic. The worst side effects I got from it were probably post pregnancy, when we guessed wrong and relowered my adderall dose but kept the cipralex up, and it turned out I needed the adderall up and the cipralex down, but I just remember generally feeling bad and spiky and anxious, in a way I know never happened when I started taking it or when we bumped my dose intentionally.",

            "It took *a lot* of tests/reassurance to get over the physical symptoms for me as well.  The *slightest* sensation in my chest would send me into a full panic.  I've called 911 and taken an ambulance ride to the hospital sooo many times thinking my heart was failing even though it was completely fine.  All it took was a little pressure, a small heart palpitation, a tight left arm, too hot a shower, too deep a breath, almost anything... it was truly horrendous, and I'm forever grateful through all of this I never gave up on trying to fix it.  \n\n\nI'm glad to hear you're actively trying to get over this as well.  Just having the slightest will to get better can take you a long way.  I wish nothing but the best for you on this difficult journey.",
            "how are you now",
            "There\u2019s been studies looking at serotonin and anxiety and some state that people with anxiety disorders actually have higher not lower levels of serotonin! Which makes sense why some people (including myself) have had horrendous experiences with ssris yeah. So many people focus on healing the anxiety without medication but what works for everyone might not work for all, but I had pretty severe panic disorder and never touched ssris after my experience with them when I was younger. I think ssris are beneficial for depression and other mental health issues, not anxiety imo.",

I was also feeling a bit hopeless and had panic attacks. However I told my Dr about it and so we started increasing very slowly (sometimes half pills) over longer periods. I will say again, it is worth just getting through it. I went from having panic attacks nearly everyday to now only having them like every few months and it allows me to process it and snap out of it. Hope this helps, remember to just be kind to yourself.",

I don\u2019t have panic attacks often, but my anxiety does affect a good amount of my life. I honestly think if I took the medication before sleeping, I\u2019d end up too anxious to sleep wondering what was going to happen even if I were a few days into taking the medication or if I took it earlier. I like the idea of taking it before bed once the medication is more routine. I just don\u2019t want the physical anxiety anymore. It sucks.",

It\u2019s day 1 and I feel hot/cold, jittery, chattering teeth, wired.  And clenching jaw, tensed up muscles.   Felt kinda euphoric body buzz the first hour or two.   I\u2019m surprised because I\u2019m only on 12.5mg to start.  Just hoping those side effects go away so I can relax.

So not two ssris but an ssri and also another type of drug, for instance. Like me, with both escitalopram and bupropion.

Stopped that at 17 & have been off anti-depressants since then (I'm 22 now). Anyway, I've been struggling with low libido for maybe 1.5 years now. It doesn't just affect me...it also affects my girlfriend. It sucks- we have sex like once a month or less. I've tried therapy & it didn't really help much. Kinda considering starting on an anti depressant to help with it. It's so scary! I rlly hope I'm not this way forever..especially since its negatively affecting my relationship w/ my gf /:",

It makes me so anxious if I have a partner in the future who wants to have an active sex life and me not being able to give it to them because of anxiety. But keep things at your own pace though, maybe it will come back eventually. Either way it\u2019s never your fault it disappeared, it\u2019s anxiety.",

It didn\u2019t prevent me from jerking off or hooking up with people but wouldn\u2019t have a boner all of a sudden if a thought popped up. Eat healthy and excercise dude and it will increase your testosterone therefore helping you with low libido (and most importantly, anxiety and depression). Try not jerking off for some time and don\u2019t even think about your situation as much, this will only feed your anxiety more therefore making you more depressed. You\u2019ll get through this!!",

Came back each time, first when I admitted that something was wrong and I needed help, second time when I finally removed myself from an unhealthy relationship I was in.

Also a combination of meltitracen and flupentixol also no side effects but also no effect \n\nI think what personally helped me was time, and also finding a sleep med I think that helped me the most. Sleeping enough and also good I think helped me before finding a med that work.\n\nSo yeah haven\u2019t found a med that works for me but I don\u2019t have depression anymore. Anxiety is a lot less and probably will just ask for beta blockers to help some of the physical symptoms of anxiety",

            "No, in my case my anxiety disorder had no effect on my libido, except when it flared up into major panic attacks, then obviously I wasn't able to do anything, sexual or otherwise.\n\nBut when things were 'just' the normal daily anxiety, that was fine. So my case is a bit different than yours.",
            "Lots of people have to take drugs for the rest of their lives, it's not unusual. With Zoloft, I tapered off it every year for the first 5 years or so, but I had severe relapses every time after about 90 days. Some people do only need to take these drugs for a short time, that's the default use of them. But if you just go back to your previous terrible condition after you stop using them, then it's probably going to be forever.",

            "I think it would return, but I don\u2019t know for sure. I\u2019m not a doctor (much to my mother\u2019s disappointment). \n\nI think you can try to increase your sex drive yourself through other methods though. Sex is all in your brain after all. I have some tips from my very personal experiences!\n\n1. Sex therapy. A good sex therapist can help identify your hangups and sexual shames and overcome them. Our society is not sex-positive and I believe it impacts all of us in big and small ways.  Release any shame you have about any kinks, desires, or fantasies. Let your brain explore them to the fullest, even if it\u2019s depraved. No one will know. \n\n2. Sex toys. For men or women! Being reminded or learning how GOOD sexual stimulation can be is life changing. For me, a vibrator helped me to desensitize my vulva and be able to orgasm from oral! I learned many new ways to cum just from trying out one simple toy. The point of sex is that it feels incredible. You can work solo to figure out how to maximize pleasure.\n\n3. Try masturbating without porn. I seriously hate porn. That\u2019s a different subject. But I think porn is a fucking killer when it comes to sex drive. Use your imagination or even something softer like a sexy movie scene. Try to sensitize your mind to sexual stimuli. Porn has made an entire generation into death grippers. \n\n4. If you have a partner you\u2019re not attracted to, getting your sex drive back will feel impossible. Every time my sex drive has decreased it\u2019s because I\u2019m turned off by my partner. Cut them loose, life\u2019s too short. You might be surprised by how horny you can be. \n\n5. If you can fuck someone else, try to have a day or two where it\u2019s ALL ABOUT YOU. they give you oral, they use toys, their sole goal is to make you feel good, for extended periods of time, with NO expectation of reciprocation. I find that being expected to reciprocate can create a mental block/anxiety to perform. Don\u2019t worry about \u201cperforming\u201d, just focus on maximizing pleasure for yourself. When I became more selfish in bed, that\u2019s when I really started having fun.\n\n6. Body image. If you have shit body image, it will impact your sex life. Delete social media, stop watching porn with giant tits and cocks. Do whatever you have to do to block out negative messaging and diet culture. You HAVE to be comfortable with your genitals, fat, cellulite, all of it. It will make a massive difference. During sex, do the positions that feel best, make or don\u2019t make noise. Do everything as authentically as you can and look the way you look. No sucking in your stomach, no posing, no fake moans, no stifling moans, just focus on pleasure. You will enjoy yourself more and become a lot more fun in bed.\n\n7. EXERCISE. Oh my god. When I worked out regularly I was horny 24/7. And more importantly, I had the stamina to have really good sex. It\u2019s challenging to enjoy a variety of sex when you get tired easily, and us with depression really do.\n\nAnyway, my solicited advice for you!! I hope you get horny and happy :). And sex isn\u2019t everything! You can live a full life without tons of crazy monkey sex, contrary to what society tells us.",

            "I'm coming back online after I forget how long, but I've stayed away from the internet (and reality) due to social anxiety. I kept myself like....off of social media and I'm technically a hermit, I don't leave my house unless I utterly have to. I'm trying to beat it this year, to actually have a twitter and a Tumblr, an these are like huge steps for me. If I don't delete them after a month that will be a bigger step.\n\nI won't leave the house, but it's baby steps. I need to actually socialize with people, it doesn't matter what form.",
            "I understand the feelings, but I think you have to be careful to not think that you are remembering and judging your past actions clearly and by some absolute measure. Current day depression and anxiety loves digging back into past \"mistakes\", judging you harshly and generating some nice meaty emotions. At the time you made the best decisions for yourself - you always do. And you know this, because you have a realistic view of how behaving differently might not have given you more enjoyment. There isn't a big straight ruler that stretches from now back into the past that lets you judge everything equally. There are a lot of different small rulers that only apply to a small period of time, measure things differently and bend and stretch to fit the times. But your depressed/anxious brain doesn't want you to have that mental flexibility and comfort.\n\nWhat matters right now is how you balance yourself on this moment - do you want to nudge yourself right now in the direction of being more social? Maybe you don't but it is actually within your control now. Your brain (default mode network) would much rather serve up some \"factual\" assessments of past behavior that can't be changed/fixed so that you feel sad than let you engage yourself in making the most of right now. You have the opportunity to fight back and change, but only now, not then.",
            "Yeah I had that realisation a while back. I started working where I do now about 2 years ago and after a year I realised that I never went out with them when they did so last year forced myself to do so. I work with a lot of young people (I'm only 29 but they are all like 19-23) and this was their normal weekend life! Then they all have traveled and they just live this exciting life when I'm sat at home most of the time just watching mine pass me by. My anxiety makes me over think things when I have friends and always made me panic about going out to meet people. I made a lot of moves in a positive direction last year then hit a wall now I just have to breath and try again.",
            "I feel like at 23,I still have the mentality of an 18 year old.\n\nI still need a lot of growing up to do, growing that never happened because I isolated myself from others",
            "Yes, but....\n\nComparison is the death of joy.\n\nYou only missed out on something by comparing your experience to the average student. But those are their experiences. The absence of partying isn\u2019t a complete loss, even if it feels like it. Even if you just couched yourself every evening for 4 years, you are still engaging with yourself in ways that others were not. As long as you are alive and thinking, your perspective and experience has intrinsic value.\n\nIt\u2019s complex, because while anxiety DOES suck away our time and life force; it also exacerbates it\u2019s own symptoms by making things FEEL worse than they really are. At some point you have do what will feel completely illogical and undeserved; you have to forgive yourself for your limitations and focus on the future unfettered by the past. \n ",
            "Yeah, all the time. It's gotten more intense as I've gotten older (I'm 25). I feel like I've lived a half-life, and I often still feel like a child. ",
            "Hi, are you me? I've spend the last week being very sad and crying about this. In my notes which I often write down when I have a session coming I wrote how it was for me on primary school, high school, sports and even after. Always wanting friends, to belong but never brave enough to reach out and invest.\n\nI've let so many connections, friendships pass me by. Now that I know what caused it all and that there is another way of doing things I've heavyly invested in a friendship. I'm so thankfull for it and thankfull for that friend, that he wants to be my friend and yet it confuses the hell out of me. I never properly learned to make and keep friends. Not that I am an unpleasent person but I always withdrew, subconciously knowing that I was not good enough",

            "Anxiety is the reason I don't go out too often unless it's to visit family or friends it SO. Other than that, I am usually at home, decaying away",
            "I literally have no friends, like people I hang out with. I have my husband, my 2 minor children (13 and 17), my 2 adult children ( 23 and 19) and their SO's that I spend time with. I talk to my Mother in Law occasionally. I haven't had contact with ANYONE on my side of the family, which is fine seeing as they are dysfunctional AF! Anyone outside of my family I usually communicate with online. Anytime someone tries to be my friend I end up isolating myself even more. I am polite to my neighbors when I see them and help them if they need it but otherwise, I stay home with the exception of going on Saturday and Sunday to run errands with my husband. I very rarely leave my house without my husband though.   \nI never experienced the going to clubs in my 20's or anything like that, then again I never really was interested in that. I got married and became a stepmother at 18, had my first birth child at 19, my 2nd at 21, lost my first son 22hours after he was born ( I was 23) and had my last baby at 26. I wasn't supposed to have any more children after my first and with my 3rd I was supposed to have my tubes ties but due to complications, I wasn't able to wait the length of time that the state required after signing the papers for the surgery. My 19yr old has cerebral palsy and hypothyroidism, my 17yr has sadly inherited all the mental illness crap from my family and my 13yr old has Autism, sensory processing disorder, ADHD, severe anxiety and learning disabilities ( mentally he is more like an 8yr old at most).   \nBasically, my whole life is my husband and kids and even without my anxiety and other crap I probably wouldn't have much time for anything else.",
            "I think about this often.\n\nWhilst on paper my life is good - I\u2019ve got a great job and I own an apartment in my late 20s - all of my friends are happily married / engaged, or have moved from my small city to Melbourne. But for my anxiety about leaving, I would have moved. But I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t even have a way of knowing if it\u2019s right for me. \n\nIt quite literally keeps me awake at night thinking that I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life in the same conceptual place, while everyone else moves on. \n\nHowever, Socrates said that it was the \u201cunexamined life\u201d that wasn\u2019t worth living. I like to think I\u2019m quite introspective, so this gives me some comfort. I\u2019m not quite sure that\u2019s what he meant, though. Maybe you can take some comfort from that?",
            "I went out a lot in high school, and have had plenty of social experiences since, but even so I have found plenty to ruminate & suffer over. In fact, much of my anxiety obsesses over how I acted in those social situations. What I\u2019m trying to say is- don\u2019t beat yourself up for not going out. Because the truth is the grass isn\u2019t always greener on the other side, people experience pain even in the situation you may have thought would fix things. I often wish I had never gone out at all and had never made any social connections, this is all just anxiety logic though. The best thing you can do is recognize that the past cannot be changed, and the sovereignty over your anxiety and depression lies in the evidence based treatment practices recommended by medical professionals. Wishing you well. ",
            "I had a breakdown early on in therapy because I saw that the person I had become and the life I have was largely a result of choices made in the grip of anxiety. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m unhappy, it\u2019s just the possibility of all the other choices I could have made if I had been braver and more present. I have gotten to a place now where that reality can exist alongside the fact of my life as it is now, but it took a lot of work. ",
            "Anxiety and depression are the reasons I didn't date anyone until I was 26, so yes I feel like I missed out on a lot, but things are better now and that's all what matters. I have not really come to terms with what my 20's looked like because my bad mental health ruined a lot for me, but maybe in time, I will. And I'm pretty okay right now. So don't lose hope if you're not even close to where you want to be yet, and focus on what you can do better now to make the most out of your future. You still have a huge chunk of your life ahead of you.",
            "Yes. Anxiety and depression are closely related and I believe the constant struggle is what brings on the depression.",
            "In college, before I knew what my anxiety was, I left the classroom and went for a walk whenever I\u2019d feel a panic attack coming on. This was my first time living on my own, and I was really anxious a lot of the time. Sometimes I would leave class and go back to my apartment because I couldn\u2019t get a hold on my panic attack. My classmates noticed this, and were unkind about it. They\u2019d ask me where I was going, but I was embarrassed so I wouldn\u2019t answer. Long story short, I was bullied in college because I\u2019d leave whenever I had panic attacks, which was often then. Even professors weren\u2019t understanding.  That ruined my college experience. \n\nHowever, I did make some lifelong friends during my college years. These friends understood my anxiety disorder and were very supportive. I actually visited my college town last summer to go to one of their weddings. ",
            "I'll be honest I didn't read your post; I just read your heading and I literally blurted out loud \"YES\".  I really want to do more this year, I want this year to be the year that I finally get what I want.  But I also know how much it sucks to get my hopes up and inevitably get let down so it's a tough spot.",
            "It sounds like you want to be someone different to the type of personality you have. I don't know you, but from what you said about proably not wanting to go to parties even if you didn't have the anxiety says to me that you just aren't that type of person.\n\nI don't have anxiety really badly compared to some people, but i am naturally anxious. I worry too much about too much and i've always been thay way. As i've got older i've found ways to help me like meditating etc. But the point is, i'll never be the party goer, i'm just not into it. Is that me or the anxiety talking? I honestly think it's just me, my personality. If i was going to spend time with friends (something that i'm lacking in at this time in my life), i would much rather go hiking somewhere, or just relax and talk in a chilled out environment. \n\nIf you genuinely would like to experience parties then there's is nothing wrong with trying to improve yourself and working towards that goal. But If you're regretting not going to parties in your school and university years because it just feels like that's the thing you should have done to \"fit in\", your not truely accepting yourself for who you are. \n\nOver the past couple of years, i feel i've become more and more comfortable with myself and forgiving of who i am. It was during a bad patch after quitting my job and being unemployed for 2 years that made me criticize every decision i had made in tbe past. I was reaching my 26th birthday and felt like i had wasted most of my 20s and accomplished nothing (i was unemployed for most of my early 20s too) and the regret was  painful. I can't really explain what helped me to let go of my regrets, but i know that once i stopped comparing myself to others my own age (something i did a lot) and only concentrated on myself, that useless chit chat in my head started to fade. Everyone's path is so different that it seems ridiculous that we have these tendencies to compare ourselves to others, it just isn't rational. \n\nMy point is, you be you, because there is no one else at all that you need to be. If you feel like the regret is coming from the fact that you're comparing to how others spent their time during those years, then maybe it's irrational thinking. Focus in on yourself more and be proud and forgiving of who you are, no matter what you've gone or going through. Because everyone single person has regrets, fears, those internal voices that try to tell us things that aren't even true, humams are a complicated mess and that's kind of comforting to know. ",
            "I'm 32 and just realized I have anxiety, and after talking to my doctor, apparently I'm depressed as well. Which now that I know, everything makes sense. I spent my early to mid 20s drinking like a fish in an attempt to fit in with my peers. It worked for helping me be social, but I also got sick of that life after awhile. \n\nMy husband and I spend a lot of time not leaving our apartment. He has depression and anxiety as well, and neither of us is a big fan of people. \n\nI often wish I had wasted less time drinking my issues away. Trying to find the right med combo and dealing with these issues at 32 kinda sucks. ",

I was always hella stressed, was super religious (another source of stress - no offense to anyone who is religious) and dated one guy who was an asshole, another who was abusive. I didn\u2019t really go to parties.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like my life really \u201cbegan\u201d until I was 23. I was single, living on my own and in a new town for the first time, and was basically forced to \u201cstart over.\u201d I reexamined what I wanted out of life. But the biggest breakthrough was that **i started living for myself and no one else.** I did what I wanted - not a boyfriend, not my parents, not my idea of \u201cgod.\u201d It\u2019s been a long road, but my life has improved dramatically.\n\nHowever, I do often have shame over the fact that I don\u2019t have the fond memories about my teenage and college years that some of my peers do. That shame says you\u2019re \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cnot good enough.\u201d It\u2019s not true.\n\nWhat\u2019s most important is how you live your life now. It sounds corny, but it\u2019s true. I try to live in the moment as best I can. I try to plan for a future I\u2019ll be excited for. I realized that if I\u2019m always feeling bad and ashamed about my past, I can\u2019t enjoy the present.\n\nIt sucks that I didn\u2019t have many friends in high school or college, and that my self esteem was nonexistent.

Sure some of them are kind of fun at the time, but tomorrow morning my friends are waking up with a few great stories (heavily doctored to cover the tequila-induced amnesia) and a hangover with a side of heartburn.

But now, 1 year after college graduation, I still regret being so anxious that I feel like I missed out on so much on college especially hearing stories from my workmates. Even now, I still think I'm not being social enough and that pushes me to find another starting point by trying to find a new work somewhere else.. over the alternative of trying to be more social now.",

            "To answer your question, Yes, I often feel like my anxiety makes it impossible to have even just have a  \"normal\" day..\n\nI was just diagnosed with ADHD and GAD last month at 21 years old, and I have always had these problems with being around large groups of people. I do not talk very much in group settings (and when/if I do it ends up coming out very quiet) and if for example I had to do a presentation or take a big test in class or something I would be very anxious and nervous the days before, and the day of i would feel sick to my stomach when i woke up, would have all these thoughts of failing the test or embarrassing myself during the presentation, irritated bowels (diarrhea), and would sweat/shake when it was getting closer to my turn to present or take a big test. \nI also had no clue I had ADHD or GAD and by high school i just assumed my social and academic problems were all my fault and didnt know what to do..and instead of asking for help I just ended avoiding situations that would cause me anxiety, didnt really hangout with anyone,and would just stay at home where I felt comfortable and safe from judgment.\n\nWhich has really fucked me up over the years, and now I'm to the point where I cant even go to the store by myself without feeling uncomfortable and always feeling like I'm being judged by everyone around me..it is so stressful! \n\nI am currently on stimulant medication and have noticed significant improvements with my ADHD symptoms but my anxiety is still very overwhelming at times and controls my life and \"happiness\"\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same?

I graduated magna cum laude and my biggest regret is that I wish I\u2019d partied more. I honestly feel like I\u2019ve failed to socialize myself throughout my whole life, and as a result I\u2019m immature and competitive in all the wrong ways. ",
            "Yes but we should keep fighting with bravery. Anxiety lies to us sometimes. ",
            "Anxiety/depression may have made you miss out on those things, but anxiety and depression now will make you feel like missing out on those things is a bigger deal than it actually is. It seems anchored in something realistic, but it's still a depression and anxiety symptom to imagine what you missed out on.  \n\n\nI've had depression and anxiety at different intensities in my life. A lot of the reasons people socialize and party is just to try to get rid of stress and feel happy. The majority of it doesn't create any lasting memories. Most of it, even if I loved it at the time, is too generalized and detached to really be personal. Not having done it leaves you imagining a big \"what if\", but I can say having done it that the details were never all that important, parties can be great but they don't mean anything. Anymore than other nights I spent gaming. What was important is that being around people made me feel happier at the time, and that's what I liked about it going forward. Lasting memories were from smaller connections or maybe bigger events like a road trip. What's important is finding something that makes you feel positive in a way you resonate with, that's it.  \n\n\nHonestly there was nothing to miss out on. At every stage of their life people have to face the struggle of how to do what makes them happy despite external and internal pressures and limitations. All that really matters is if you can do that *now.* If past experiences made you stronger in doing that going forward. Struggling to make that happen now it makes very little difference that I \"went out\" in high school, all I can really hold dear is the memory of the people I liked at the time and the emotional resonance of the relationship I had with them.  \n\n\nAnd again, the ruminating reflection and feeling of loss or missing out can itself be a manifestation of a symptom of depression.",

            "Damn are you me? This hit me harder than a bus. It really really sucks and fustrates me to no fucking end. I'm so pissed at it- I wish it would die in a hole and go away already. But life isn't like that. Some of your problems never go away, so you have to find ways to live around them. For me, to overcome my current anxiety I become more anxious of something else. Too anxious to go to that event and make new friends? Now become anxious of being alone again without any human interaction for the rest of your life- suddenly the initial anxiety isn't so bad after all, and I go. But the fight never stops, and you may not win every single one but god you've gotta fight back every once in a while. I can relate, OP, I know the fustration I really do. I blamed my mum for it, and I blamed life in itself for my missed experiences. But ultimately in the end it was all my fault for not fighting back. Sorry for the ramble. ",
            "I swear I could relate so much to this.\n\nI've suffered mental health for as long as I can remember. I think my school life was ok initially but because of my dad being away for work and mom working, I didn't have anyone for guidance or do the father stuff. I have a really bad relationship with him upto the extent that I get anxious everytime I am around him.\n\nWhen I grew bit older but still in high school, I could see myself become so self concious and had great difficulty in making friends. I started procrastinating in an attempt to ignore it. I was so anxious about everything, couldn't concentrate and silent.\n\nMoving to college, I saw a whole new world as I tried to socialise and found how complicated that was for me. Anxiety was common theme since high school until now but I saw depression too. I remember having so many different phases of emotions in one single day. I could see myself getting angry at everything. I couldn't talk to people because of social anxiety and no one told me that somethings wrong. \n\nIn college, first time I had a major anger outburst and I could feel myself going out of control after a fight with my parents. That was the first time I told them that I need to see a doctor. Somethings wrong. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I didn't follow up much coz I could feel medicines altering my mood so much. I became passive. \n\nIn office and now I still had issues making friends. I started mumbling words and lost most of my confidence. People around me were getting married whereas I could hardly hold a conversation with anyone without my head and heart bursting out. Ofcourse I've not been in any relationship. The one that could be, I just chose to chicken out because of confidence. I am so possessive of people around me that I am afraid they'll leave me too. \n\nI can't remember when was the last time I smiled openly, cried at all, laughed. My OCD to have everything in order helps me with work but almost everything else pulls me down. \n\nI had short stints of doctor visits but I just couldn't follow any of those. \n\nTo be honest, at this moment, I hardly know what's normal or what's happy. That scares me, because no one seems to understand that. Yeah, I think I missed normal. ",
            "I missed all of high school because of my anxiety.",
            "I know exactly what you mean. It made me feel exactly the same growing up and I look back now with so much sadness at how much I missed out on. Sometimes I see young girls walk down the street with their friends laughing and I feel happy for them but also jealous, that I never got that childhood, I could never be that carefree and joyful. It's something I've had to come to terms with, accept and let go of. It's just that we cant change the past, all we can do is give ourselves the best life we can now... ",
            "While I agree with you in large part, there is an upside to be had.\n\nI have been able to dodge some bullets. I didn't pursue a promotion at my former job because I knew it would wreak havoc with my anxiety. Being in CCed in numerous 1am and 2am email chains made me realize I made the right decision, as did the fact that my former manager is now in counseling to contend with the stress she dealt with.  \nI pay close attention to my physical and mental health due to the toll anxiety had been taking. I eat better, exercise, do yoga, meditate, and do CBT. My anxiety forced me to take control of my health. I am far healthier than a good many people my age (I am 53).  \nI am more empathetic.  Dealing with anxiety (moderate depression too) has caused me to become aware of the impact of both. I don't want to see anyone else go down this same rocky road.",

It is important to understand that since you know now the root of the withdrawal, there is no need to regret or feel shame because of it. Instead, little by little engage in social activity. I know it may be terrifying, but BABY STEPS. Saying \u201chave a good day\u201d when a person leaves the elevator or smiling at kind strangers in the street is a start.  It may be totally uncomfortable at first, but if you want to at least attempt at some social interaction, you do have to start small, and get used to be uncomfortable. \n\nAlso understand you are neither alone nor behind the curve! Social interaction today is very odd , thus you will not be the only one uncomfortable. \n\nGood luck! ",

            "I have been on meds for depression and anxiety for more than 2 years now. I started it when I was 20. I still hear my family telling me to stop taking it as if its a choice for me. Its really difficult to get going despite everyone criticising my decision of continuing with meds.",
            "My parents were super iffy about me starting an antidepressant at 15, but my anxiety had come to the point where I would have major anxiety attacks just by being in my school building without classes even starting yet. Two years later, my mom told me how glad she was that I started taking them because it helped in ways that nobody could've imagined. My social anxiety had not only improved, but I had become a borderline extrovert and I started making more jokes and hanging out with family more and everything. It's not for everyone, I know people who can't take medication because they don't like how it feels, but I think if someone truly believes that it could help them and they have safe access to a doctor and medication, they should see if it helps.",

So the guilt is real, i berate myself for being weak, as if im giving up but I just want to be ok, thats all i ask for. \n\nIm scared to think i will never be able to live without them but so many people take them for years or their whole lives and knowing that makes me feel a bit better",

I now feel like it's almost liberating in that it has given me more control over my wellbeing, as opposed to fully relying on a professional.",
            "Been on citalopram for several year now, ever since my last big fight with the depression beast. It definitely doesn\u2019t fix everything, but it keeps me from going to the Dark Place. I came off it twice before and ended up back in the hole less than 6 months later. Never doing that again. \n\nI hate the idea that meds for mental illness are seen as a bad thing. My brain chemicals are weird, so I take a pill to fix my brain chemicals. No different than someone taking thyroid meds or heart pills. \n\nOn a slightly funny note, I\u2019m lucky that the only side effect I ever got from citalopram was uncontrollable yawning. For like 6 weeks, I. Could. Not. Stop. Yawning. I had to google whether that is even a thing and apparently it\u2019s one of the less common but still possible side effects. Thank god that wore off! 6 weeks of people going \u201care we keeping you up?\u201d and things like that at work.",

            "Yes, yes, yes! \n\nMore people need to know this and accept it without shame or stigma attached to it.\n\nI come from a culture where mental illnesses mostly are not really understood for what they are. This makes it hard for people to admit that they need help.\n\nIt took me almost 10 years to get proper help. Had my first anxiety in my second year of uni, and didn't see a doctor or get meds until I was 32 and the pressures of work and life just broke me. \n\nThe recovery process was long, and I often regret how it took me so long to get me help. I could have saved myself a lot of hardship.\n\nNow, I'm 37 and have been on different meds for the past 5 years. It took a good 2 years to finally find the one that works best for me (combo of Paroxetine & Mirtazapine). \n\nMost recently due to depression becoming an issue, we added Bupropion and over the past 3 months on it, I'm glad it is working to get me motivated to get up in the morning. I procrastinate less, and it's easier for me to get things done.\n\nI have accepted the fact that yes, these meds may not be perfect (there is no silver bullet), but it gives me the ability to be more in control of my life. I also accept the fact that I may have to be on meds long term....and that is OK.\n\nQuality of life is the most important thing, if taking meds helps a patient with mental illness improve on that. Then the goal is reached.\n\nWishing you all a wonderful day. Stay safe.",

We have too many things against us and a little medication to help reduce the hostility of life is not going to hurt, as long as the prescribing doctor is willing to be flexible and to listen to your feedback and adjust medication.",
            "Honestly so true. Everyone recommends the usual coping mechanisms, like exercise, therapy, going outside etc. But they don't understand being so paralyzed you can't even do those things to begin with.

            "My recommendation, do not seek medicinal cures. There are no cure-alls, there is no pill you can swallow to cure it, any effect is temporary.

I've been up to my eyeballs on medication it was working so poorly for me that I ended up tapering off and stopping it without going to see the doctor because I was too anxious to call the doctor for an appointment.

As long as you've got a doctor working with you there really isn't much a downside to trying.",

And now it\u2019s like it stresses me out and it\u2019s too much. I make myself do it cos if i run away from it i know I\u2019ll avoid everything and i know from past relapses that i just cant afford to do that. \n\nIt\u2019s so tough to deal anxiety and the physical symptoms cos they make you down and even more depressed because it makes ya feel like shit! It\u2019s such a vicious cycle. I feel for you man, but you got this, i promise! \n\nYou did the right thing by ditching the bad food and getting a new job!

I do force myself to move on now days tho! \n\nSometimes i have to admit defeat and get on the doctors waiting list for therapy, but it takes fuckin ages, so i basically just have to google \u201cthings that help anxiety and depression without therapy or meds\u201d and just do them routinely basically!\n\nI write things down a lot. I basically write down diary entries as i can go back when i feel a certain way and be like \u201coh i felt like this before and i was ok\u201d\n\nAlso, i force myself to ride out panic attacks when they strike.

            "This is a marker of how well I'm doing with anxiety, when I'm in a more anxious phase, I tend to need it more. Right now I have a good routine of meditation, excercise and self-love so for the first time in several years, I'm able to sleep without listening to anything and I can sit and do work (programming mostly) without any noise. \n\nI still really struggle to go the gym without listening to a podcast but that's an area where my anxiety can hit me (because of elevated heart rate and some health anxiety!) But also because it can be quite boring, and I can learn stuff in that time as well. \n\nWe're all on our own journey and I know I needed it at times, but my advice to you if you ever start to feel that these crutches start to own you, is get into some kind of meditation to learn to be ok with stillness. I personally do a mixture of mindfulness meditation and the Wim Hof method (cold exposure, crazy breath work etc) and while I'm really not evangelising about any of this, I feel more free than I have in years.\n\nMuch much much love to you all out there on this forum, it's been a great comfort to me at times, just remember to live one day at a time. X",
            "I used to do this but my therapist said I should practice sitting alone with my thoughts, so I did. It sucked but I must say it has helped a ton with keeping my mind clear and logical when dealing with high levels of anxiety.\n\nA solid piece of advise that he gave me is to act as though you are a third party to your own thoughts. simply observe them from a far rather than standing in the middle of the mess of thoughts. He said to think of it as though you are standing on an over pass watching cars pass by having the cars be your thoughts. Give them the time that they deserve but never dwell on any one of them for more than needed. Just like traffic some cars will move fast some will move slow, your thoughts will be similar. Some will take a bit longer to get out of frame and thats ok but make sure that it continues moving and doesn't stop.",

I would literally have my gf on skype, friends playing on the background on my laptop, and some documentary on TV all at the same time, so I could be always distracted (I would seriously obsess about the attacks, wondering if that's what my life was gonna be from then on). Now I just have some show playing when I go to bed, but mostly to keep my mind from running.

For instance, when I have on an emotional song, and it's a nice day out, I may think about going out with a friend or something but then decide against it. When I don't have the background noise on, it's like a total switch in my clarity of judgement and I'm suddenly motivated to do those things. It can ease pain but also affect judgement.",

When my brain is blah blah blah and I can\u2019t sleep I like to listen to this talkshow with very low volume in one earphone, like I can\u2019t make what they are saying or otherwise I will pay attention to what they are saying. The nurse and the nutritionist they all believe in that app they recommend, they just don\u2019t understand I won\u2019t pay a monthly rate for a recording to tell me to breath and calm down when it does the opposite. I even bought one of those plastic tube earphone so I don\u2019t have to worry about extra radiation while I sleep cause I use it pretty much most of every night or in the early mornings so I can get that little extra sleep.\nI just realized that I believe the ticking of the clock on the wall also helps so I can just sit on the sofa if I just want to read but not tv or I would feel like I gotta pay attention.\nThose people at the integral Drs office believe that the brain needs quiet time at least 5-10min of no activity per day.

My anxiety and depression did get better after therapy but I still heavily relied on coffee. If I went two days without it, I\u2019d be in cold sweats and vomitting, even nausea. I became depressed again, didn\u2019t get out of bed and rather I did worst things than coffee itself like taking sleeping pills and alcohol just so time would pass by faster. Then I got back on coffee, feeling guilty that I relied on it. Though these past few months, I drink coffee everyday except one day a week. I took then in moderation, 1 cup a day on the regular. Tired days would be 2 cups and a cup would be around 240 mL. When I took it in moderation and my body got use to it, the effects weren\u2019t as bad. I can\u2019t deny when I take too much I can\u2019t sleep at night and get jittery and lose control, though I just try to calm myself with chamomile tea at the end of the day. If that doesn\u2019t work I try deep breathing. \n\nI started to feel not guilty for relying on coffee, it wasn\u2019t as though it was killing me because I took it in moderation. It\u2019s a unhealthy habit but also healthier than going back to old ways. \n\nJust take it slow, everything will sort itself out and if ever need someone. Just pm me",

I couldn\u2019t sleep one night because of some work stress, and that made me anxious about the next night, and the next\u2026 and it snowballed into about almost a year of medicated sleep. I had very bad depression at one point when I was prescribed certain antidepressants (cannot remember what it was anymore) so I stopped it and got on Lorazepam instead. Lorazepam and melatonin were godsend. I have also since then settled the sleep issues (though a slight anxiety regarding that remains). But what has been left behind for me is debilitating heath anxiety that I have been trying to cope with the past two to three years. Tbh, I wonder if it\u2019s a manifestation of the trauma from the sleep anxiety. I\u2019m sorry I cannot answer your question for sure, but it does sound like there is some anxiety or depression involved. My personal opinion is that not all medications are going to work for you, you need to find the right ones. I went through two medications that gave me terrible depression before lorazepam worked. I have since stopped lorazepam for more than a year, but thinking of going back on them due to a current physical health concern.

Even if you have to, make out fake forms and print them out and get her to sign them. Whether she knows they're fake or not will be up to you. She has to show herself that nothing has happened over the last 10/20/30 years and its not going to. But telling her won't help, she has to literally see it.",
            "I feel like we've done this with her over and over again.  It's the only way to get her to sign documents necessary to move things forward at times.  We had spent hours one day on what should've taken only 15 minutes to complete.  She believes no one is on her side.  Not her own lawyer and, at times, not even my father.  Believing that she couldn't put her signature on the paper without first having all of the fields filled in. Even the ones that were not applicable to her.  Implying that my father has some evil plan to send the documents in incomplete to have her arrested and thrown into jail.\n\nThe trouble that I find is that my mother has no motivation or willingness to help herself.  She doesn't try to fight back against these fears at all.  This is where the primary issue lies in my eyes.  Getting her to see that nothing has happened in past years would require that she first fights back against the anxiety that clouds this judgement.  I don't know how to first get passed this block.",
            "She gets past the block by facing what started it through Therapy. Theres always an origin. It'll be up to her to figure out what that is though.",
            "It could be any number of things.  Before this came about, there were some really rough times.  She lost both of her parents and mother in law.  My father had a near death experience with a heart attack. As did my uncle (her brother in law.) My mother's job was sold off to another company.  Forcing her to start over at a new place of employment.  She never grasped technology and couldn't understand how to function in her new position.  Any combination of these events likely caused it.  Such a bad run I swear it's like something out of a movie."

It's hard to control or even uncontrollable at times.\n\nIt can be the littlest of things to spark the anxiety too, once it gets rolling it's a snowball. \n\nMy first panic attack came out of nowhere when I was 27.  Never even had anxiety before.  Took me 2 years to get back to a sense of normal.  You should definitely see one of you haven't. Learn self coping to help get you through the attacks or get medications for them. It'll help a lot.",

No. That's why I'm here right now, I'm in the middle of a panic attack and talking about it helps me through it. That plus the ativan I take when one occurs. Waiting for it to kick in so my heart will stop pounding.  It's not a daily thing though and I know what's triggering it.\n\nI found that cold water shocks your system and kind of acts like a reset to your body which is why the cold showers are probably helpful to you.  I tended to listen to music game shows on my commute to work, helped kept my mind occupied.  Exercising definitely helps if you can manage to push yourself to do it.",

Was it after the month long in and out hospital visit? \n\nIt is! Whenever I would feel the cold water on my body it feels like my body just falls into relaxation.  I\u2019m glad to hear the things I did helped you out in some way too.  I\u2019m still trying to look for more ways to \u201ctolerate\u201d my anxiety whenever it comes up.

At one point near the end of it I asked what they were giving me to help me in the hospital, they told me ativan. I said can I get prescribed that? It seems to be the only thing that helps! \n\nI took it almost every day for about 2-3 weeks, but I wasn't going to the hospital anymore. Then they slowly faded away.  That was 7 years ago.  I was prescribed 60 in November 2020. I have one left from that bottle.\n\n10-20 of those ended up going to my wife though because she thought it would be fun to join the anxiety club :(",
            "Hey! I'm sorry your anxiety hit you again. It's definitely going to come and go throughout your life. I know that sounds awful but the best thing to do is find a way to fight it mentally. Because as awful as it can make you feel physically, it all starts mentally. \n\nWhenever it hits, you have to make your brain realize that it's being stupid and you have nothing to be anxious about. Deep breaths in through the nose, out through the mouth.  Force your brain to go somewhere else. Try and think of an old happy memory and play through it in your head. It's all about beating it before it gets too far. \n\nThis is a lot easier said than done.  I've gotten to the point where I can fight it off a majority of the time, but there are still times where it wins. I wish there was some magic way of fixing it or stopping it.\n\nI hope you win your fight quickly. I'm here if you need to talk!",
            "I went back after my post to check your post history to see how it was affecting you this time. \n\nI saw you were able to use talkspace for awhile and it was helping before the insurance change. Have you looked into betterhelp? It's similar. They should both offer financial assistance that you can look into as well. Not sure if you would be able to get it since you have insurance though, but it's worth looking into. If that doesn't work you can try and find a therapist that does take your insurance that offers virtual visits. They usually tend to text as well. \n\nThen if none of that works you can always call or text the suicide hotline.  You don't have to be suicidal for them to help you. Your not going to end up on a list and then they come and find you and put you in a mental hospital.  They can be helpful, but they're not therapists. They're counselors. But being able to talk to someone in a time of need can be the biggest help of all.",

            "That happens to me too! I would randomly be at work or even somewhere public, and bam the anxiety clouds over me.  \n\nHave you found out what your triggers were yet? For me I think what triggers my anxiety is the dark or when I\u2019m alone with my thoughts.",

I got to the point last night where I had went to my dad\u2019s photo (he passed away when I was younger) and I was basically praying and begging him to help me get through this anxiety - I was begging and begging for help. \n\nI don\u2019t get it, I was good for a couple months and now this is all coming back.  I feel so helpless and so scared.  I think I will try calling the suicide hotline like you suggested, or maybe live text them I know they have that option.",

But it came back this Thursday and here where I\u2019m from Daylights savings is November 6 \u2014- backstory last year I was at peak anxiety where I would be so scared if night time because I knew I would wake up with panic attacks.

I\u2019ll download it right now and do research on how much it would be because I would be down to sacrifice some $$ for my mental health. \n\n\nI used to drink NyQuil and sleeping aids so I would just sleep through the night.  I think I\u2019m just getting so scared and don\u2019t want to fall back onto that routine again. \n\nThank you again for responding to me.",
            "Let me rephrase that, I\u2019m sorry if it\u2019s confusing.\n\nI was told by my therapist when I brought up my concern about taking medication for my anxiety.  She said there were some that I could just take that would be like \u201cTylenol\u201d basically just taking it as needed.",

It's an every day struggle for her with a lot of things, not just anxiety. She's on a lot of medications as well, daily and as needed and she still struggles.",
            "I can't remember from our last talks, but are you on any anxiety medication?  They have daily medication (which I personally wouldn't recommend if it's not an every day thing, but I'm not a doctor) and as needed medication such as ativan or clonazepam.  You take these when you feel it coming on and it calms you before you have the anxiety attack.  They're very helpful, but also very dangerous to become addictive (I never had that problem though.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not going to go away forever. Just enjoy the good times and know the bad times won't be as long as you get better at fighting it every time it hits. Best you can do is find the trigger and try to avoid it as much as possible.",
            "Then yes.  That's how ativan is.  They're Benzo medications.  Super addicting so you have to be careful.  It's a quick fix, but not a long term solution. So it's good for anxiety attacks but not so much every day anxiety because you don't want to take Benzos every day. \n\nThey have SSRIs they prescribe for every day anxiety (things like lexapro or zoloft.)\n\nMy anxiety these days is triggered by health problems, whether it be mine or my wife's. The stress overwhelms my body and off I go into anxiety land, so that's why I don't need every day medication.",

It\u2019s pretty hefty fee, but I\u2019m willing to make that small financial sacrifice. \n\nThank you for reassuring me that yes anxiety will NEVER go away, but being able to cope with it makes living with  anxiety so much better.  I also want to thank you for taking the time to give me advice, listening in on me, and also being there for a stranger even after months later! I truly do appreciate you so much and it actually helps me being able to be out and open to someone online about the struggles of anxiety.  Thank you for also being open about your own struggles with anxiety and how you cope with it.",
            "That\u2019s what I\u2019m scared of, medication wise.  I don\u2019t want to become addicted to it trying to fix my anxiety and then causing other problems. \n\nI was prescribed lexapro, but after reading the multiple pages long of side effects - it literally gave me more anxiety! So I ended up just not taking it at all. \n\nWhen your anxiety gets triggered like that and you go to anxiety land, you don\u2019t take the Ativan?  What do you do to cope with the anxiety if you don\u2019t take Ativan?",
            "It is a hefty fee!  That's the same thing my wife is using right now.  $200/month sucks when insurance should be covering it, but it's better than having to suffer from any kind of mental issues.\n\nFinding that coping mechanism is key.  It's different for everyone.  Still trying to help my wife find hers.  She's had some recent success with adult coloring books, might be something worth looking into, not sure what your likes/dislikes are though.  For me it's baseball.  Watching/listening to anything baseball tends to calm me down.  Sucks during November-March when there is no baseball though.\n\nI know it's hard, especially if you don't know or have anyone that deals with it.  It's a hard issue to comprehend if you've never dealt with it.  Same thing with depression.  People tell you to cheer up.  Stop being sad.  Uhhh I WOULD IF I COULD! I can't control my feelings right now!  lol\n\nI'm always here if you need help or advice!",
            "Baseball is my drug. It helps my depression and anxiety. It's my escape. So during baseball season I just turn on something baseball related and escape.  The only time I feel the need to take ativan is when I get an attack at night and I know I need to sleep, because I won't be able to sleep during the attack.\n\n12:30am for me right now. Still waiting for it to kick in and knock me out (took it at 11:45pm.)  Gotta wake up in 5.5 hours...\n\nA bit of advice going forward. Do not look up your medications. Do not look up your symptoms.  Anxiety will mimic symptoms so if you know something could happen, your anxiety will make it happen mentally (but not really.)\n\nTrust the doctors and always give the medications time. If bad things will happen, you'll usually notice in the first 2 weeks, but it can take 6 to 8 weeks to feel the positive effects.  Lexapro and SSRIs are not addictive. Also know what helps some people makes other people worse. That's why they have a bunch of different kinds. Lexapro tends to be the safest and goto entry point for anxiety and depression though. My wife was on it before covid and worked great for her.",

I feel the anxiety blanket over me, but it\u2019s not as bad. I\u2019m trying to think logically and telling myself the pain in my chest is from the cold weather. It\u2019s helping so far, but deep deep down the feeling of anxiety because of it is trying to escape.  I\u2019m going to try and go back to sleep!",
            "For me the \u201cmedication\u201d I would take and kind of over did was NyQuil/zzzquil.  I literally would take it every night so that I would just make myself sleep and not fall into the pit of anxiety.  I basically just sedated myself to prevent the anxiety from occurring I know this is so bad.  \n\n\nBaseball is good escape! It\u2019s good you found a way to distract your mind.  Im still finding ways for mine, I think finding this Reddit account and finding people with similarities has helped me - bit. \n\n\nGoodnight!! I hope you wake up well rested. It\u2019s currently 9:38pm my time. \n\nThank you for that advice.  I know looking it up and reading up on it is bad; but my mind starts to wonder you know.  And yes yes I\u2019m just feeding into my anxiety. \n\nWhen your wife took lexapro; did she have any side effects? \n\nI think the whole me vs. medication thing is that I want anxiety to just POOF disappear with one pill (which I know is impossible)",
            "My anxiety always seems to come at night when I'm trying to sleep. Usually when I have work the next day because I know I need sleep.  I also get anxious when someone close to me gets sick or I start feeling unwell. \n\nMy wife on the other hand has been anxious 24/7 for about the past 3 years.\n\nWhen I first started having anxiety attacks, I would constantly wake up in a state of panic. Tight chest, heart racing, it was the worst. It just stopped one day and have no idea why, but I can't complain.\n\nExercising, even if it's just stretching for a few minutes or going for a 15 minute walk, can be very helpful as well. Also cutting down/out your caffeine intake (that was a big culprit of my anxiety at the beginning.)",
            "Side effects for my wife on lexapro, Not that I can think of. Maybe weight gain. But that's a side effect of almost every antidepressiant/ anxiety/ birth control medication. Or maybe I just made her \"fat and happy\" lol.",
            "Finding the trigger to your anxiety can be that POOF pill. If you know what's causing it, it can make it easier to tackle it. \n\nIs someone stressing you out? Worried about money? Health? Death?  Find out what that trigger is, if you don't know already and your half way to beating it!",
            "I think my ativan is finally working so I might pass out soon.  If you ever need to talk through the anxiety hit me up. It's always easier to talk to someone that understands it and knows what you're going through.  Hope you get through it quickly!",
            "See, that happened to me! All the anxiety just stopped one day.  But it drastically came back! \n\nI don\u2019t drink caffeine, I have stopped.  I do exercise running/walking, but the anxiety still creeps in. \n\nI know you had mentioned that your wife\u2019s health was one of the triggers for her anxiety.  When she does coloring books if I may ask, how is the environment around her? Does she prefer to have it quiet or have some side noises here and there? \n\nThe past few days my anxiety have been tamed; but it\u2019s because my boyfriend have been staying with me.  Last night my anxiety did not hit or anything BECAUSE I was tired from work and just fell asleep. \n\nI\u2019m finding myself overworking and picking up as many days as I can because that\u2019s the only thing that would get me \u201ctired\u201d enough to sleep the anxiety away.  Working out doesn\u2019t do much to make me as tired.",

            "Yes that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing.  I\u2019ve been journaling and writing down the times it occurs.  But it feels like such little things that seem so insignificant that triggers it.",

She said it was the only way to keep her anxiety away.",
            "So, just to make you feel a little more normal with the anxiety, I had a tick on me yesterday morning and pulled it off.  My anxiety has been through the roof ever since then because it was kind of sore so I googled how long is a tick bite sore for only to find out it shouldn't be sore...then I read up on all the tick illnesses like lyme disease and what not and now I have all those symptoms.  But I'm sure it's just my anxiety mimicking what I read...hopefully.  Anxiety sucks.",

So far no anxiety at all, but I did wake up in the middle of the night again with some slight overthinking but I managed to fall back asleep. \n\nHow was your day today? I hope it was a better day for you as well.",
            "Hi, one year later and my anxiety has gotten a lot better.  I don\u2019t wake up in the middle of the night anymore struggling and having my panic attacks.  Thank you for this brief moment you reassured me and talked me through asking advice.",

As soon as she gets better my anxiety will most likely go away. \n\nAnd no problem! Gotta look out for other anxious people! I know it can be hard for some that don't have a support system just due to the fact that they don't know others with anxiety that understand the feeling you're going through.",

You can make it fancier by adding milk/heavy/sour cream, butter and cheese. Creamy, comforting goodness.\n\n2. Boiled potatoes with fried egg, sour cream and cucumbers. Salt and pepper included of course. Trust me.\n\n3. Take a slice of bread, put anything you have on it (I like the tomato/onion/pickle combination), cover with cheese and chuck into an oven till cheese melts.\n\n4. Get some leftover pasta/noodles, dump some heavy/sour cream and milk on a pan, add pasta, pepper, salt, some parmesan style cheese and cherry tomatoes.\n\n5. Buy a mix of frozen veggies (cauliflower, potato, carrots, parsley root, mushrooms, etc.), dump in the water, add some stock cubes or store bought stock, some rice/barley as a filler, salt, pepper and you got yourself a soup with like no effort. If you make it in a big pot you got a week worth of food. \n\n6. Add curry paste/spice to anything, really. Some instant ramen with a bit of curry paste, carrot/sweet corn and an egg can change your world. Add it to some ready stock with coconut milk and lime juice - you can add noodles for a soup, or thicken it with flour for a sauce. \n\n7. If you're really, really struggling, buy yourself some vitamins/electrolytes tablets and snack on some digestive/tea cookies/plain muesli bars you can keep on hand. I do that very often in the mornings, since eating right after I wake up makes me sick, so instead I need to wait 2-5 hours to eat anything more than that.\n\nAside from cooking time (boiled potatoes is ~20-35 minutes, soup with rice/pasta is ~20 min, baking is ~10 min) preparation for all of those is less than 5 minutes (at most 10, but that's pushing it) and mostly requires just dumping all ingredients into one container and then just waiting for it to be ready. \n\nThey are a bit more complicated than a toast with butter/jam, but also healthier and just more pleasant in general. Eating them does not feel like you're at the bottom and all the carbohydrates help with serotonin/dopamine. \n\nI still recommend electrolytes if you can take them, though.",

I like ginger ale because the bubbles help with gas, and I have some hard ginger candy that's great to settle your stomach. Try to keep water with you and take small sips frequently. I found that reading something light was a good distraction, and so was watching silly tv. I also napped a lot, and usually felt better afterwards. Panic attacks are exhausting, so get your rest. Physical activity was tiring, and I was definitely worried I'd pass out or feel sick, but it also helped to move around a bit. I tried to do simple tasks, like unloading the dishwasher or folding laundry, with my mom close by just in case. That way I could get my body moving a bit for short periods of time.\n\nHang in there. This too shall pass. Mine did, and boy was I worried it wouldn't.",

They seek to help.  I was taking Xanax but I started to like it a little too much and haven\u2019t taken it in two weeks, it\u2019s insanely addictive.  Trying to do at least one productive thing a day is helpful, even if it is just making you bed or unloading the dishwasher.  I hope you find some relief soon.",

Best of luck to you, I hope you feel better soon.",

            "I'm truly sorry to hear about what you're going through. Depression can feel like an insurmountable challenge, especially when coupled with feelings of regret, shame, and anger. It's important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle, and there are steps you can take to start feeling better.\r  \n\r  \nWhile therapy is often a crucial component of healing from depression, I understand that it may not be accessible to everyone due to financial constraints. In addition to the steps you're already taking, such as going to the gym, taking supplements, and engaging in hobbies, I'd like to suggest exploring mindfulness meditation as a potential tool for managing your depression.\r  \n\r  \nMindfulness meditation involves cultivating awareness of the present moment and learning to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It can help you develop greater self-compassion, reduce rumination, and build resilience in the face of challenges.\r  \n\r  \nI've personally found the Mindspace: Mindful Meditation app to be a valuable resource in my own journey with mental health. The app offers a variety of guided meditations specifically designed to support mental well-being, including sessions focused on managing depression, building self-esteem, and cultivating a sense of inner peace.\r  \n\r  \nWhile meditation is not a substitute for professional treatment, it can complement other coping strategies and provide you with a sense of empowerment and agency in managing your mental health. I encourage you to give it a try and see if it resonates with you. You can download the Mindspace: Mindful Meditation app from the App Store .\r  \n\r  \nRemember to be gentle with yourself and take things one step at a time. Seeking support from online communities or helplines can also be beneficial when professional therapy is not accessible. You deserve support and compassion as you navigate this challenging journey.",

There is always to make it work too. You just have to put in the effort. The past and regret are powerful blackholes that can suck us in and keep us from advancing towards the future. While doing popular things like going to the gym, having a pet and a hobby are nice, they aren't addressing your depression. They are distractions from it that don't last forever. \n\nThe most important thing you can do for yourself right now is look into therapists and psychiatrists around you and online. Most have financing options or ways to make care more affordable or at the very least get you seen. You can't change who you were or what you have done, all you can do is change what you do now. Focus on getting your needs met, which includes your mental health."
